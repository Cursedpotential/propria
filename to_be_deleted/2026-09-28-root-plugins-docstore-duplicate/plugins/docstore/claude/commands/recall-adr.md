ADR / decision recall for: $ARGUMENTS

!`C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe "E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Probata/probata/scripts/docstore/recall.py" adr $ARGUMENTS 2>&1`

Show the table exactly as printed. Then at most three bullets naming the governing decision and its path. Superseded ADRs are hidden by default; if the answer may be an older ruling, rerun with `--status all` and say which one supersedes it. If the top score is under 0.3, say there is no strong match.
