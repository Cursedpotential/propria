Memory recall for: $ARGUMENTS

!`C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe "E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Probata/probata/scripts/docstore/memory.py" $ARGUMENTS 2>&1`

Show the table exactly as printed. Then at most three bullets: what past sessions established, with the date. Memory is recollection, not ruling: if it conflicts with the docstore (`/recall-doc`, `/recall-adr`), the docstore wins and the conflict is reported.
