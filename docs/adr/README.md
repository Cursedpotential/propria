Lightweight [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-style records of decisions that are **locked** —
so they are not silently re-litigated or forgotten across sessions/agents.

**Rule:** any decision that changes architecture, a dependency, a data boundary, or a security/HITL
guarantee gets an ADR. One short record. Supersede (don't edit) when a decision changes.

**Status values:** Proposed · Accepted · Superseded by ADR-XXXX · Deprecated.

| 0022 | Comprehensive living wiki — dual-purpose (AI + human), covers everything | Accepted (vision; build deferred) |
| 0023 | Universal exposure — API-first, MCP-wrapped (every tool/agent/workflow) | Accepted (pairs with 0017) — **SUPERSEDED by D-107 (2026-08-29 — AgentOS MCP host retired)** |
| 0024 | SurrealDB = store/session/Knowledge/memory layer; Graphiti stays cognition | ~~Accepted~~ **Superseded** — vector/Knowledge role by 0027 (then 0040 → Weaviate); store/session/memory role by **0043** (flatten executed 2026-08-04, operational store is Postgres). Nothing remains in force. |
| 0025 | Topology: Agno core + IBM ContextForge tool gateway + LiteLLM model gateway; minimize custom | Accepted (clarifies 0015; reinforces 0017) — **SUPERSEDED by ADR-0042 (LiteLLM retired) + D-107 (Agno core retired), 2026-07-29/2026-08-29** |

| 0031 | CaseBible entity/temporal-graph layer = Neo4j + Graphiti, isolated by group_id | Accepted (extends 0014/0018) — **SUPERSEDED by D-070 (2026-08-25 — Graphiti suspended)** |
| 0032 | Drop the PG Multicorn FDW federation hub; cross-source reach = pg_duckdb + native drivers | Accepted (supersedes 2026-06-14 federation-hub stance) |
| 0033 | `server/` package layout (Option A repack) | Accepted (merged + deployed; amended 2026-07-09 — tools promoted to `server/tools/`, `vendored/` scope broadened) |
| 0034 | Multi-level custody hashing + signed/timestamped chain of custody | **Accepted** (2026-06-27; merged 2026-08-05 — was the "STRANDED" gap in this ledger) |
| 0035 | Tools sub-namespacing, tool_finder extraction, and the record contract's home | Accepted & Implemented (merged `8240205`, deployed + verified 2026-07-10; supersedes/relates ADR-0033) |
| 0036 | DozerDB multi-DB RBAC — memory/evidence isolation | Accepted (owner 2026-07-29; execution pending) |
| 0037 | Graphiti MCP via ContextForge, write-enabled | Accepted (owner 2026-07-29; blocker cleared per D-028; retire `:8071` door pending) — **SUPERSEDED by D-070 (2026-08-25 — Graphiti suspended)** |
| 0038 | Agno agents ↔ Graphiti as native library | Accepted (owner 2026-07-29) — **SUPERSEDED by D-070 (Graphiti suspended) + D-107 (Agno host retired), 2026-08-25/2026-08-29** |
| 0039 | Graphiti extraction LLM = hosted structured-output model | Accepted (owner 2026-07-29; implemented in practice 2026-07-04 via NIM nemotron, lane now Portkey) — **SUPERSEDED by D-070 (2026-08-25 — Graphiti suspended)** |
| 0040 | Vector substrate revisit — Weaviate LOCKED (vs pgvector / keep-Milvus) | Accepted (2026-07-27; supersedes 0026/0027 engine choice; **cutover VERIFIED 2026-08-09 D-042; `data-vector`/Milvus DOWN deliberately since 2026-08-10**) |
| 0041 | Memgraph = additive temporal GraphRAG layer, read-side only (Neo4j/DozerDB stays) | Accepted (2026-07-28; Variant B) |
| 0042 | Portkey replaces LiteLLM as THE model gateway; LiteLLM retired | Accepted (2026-07-29; supersedes 0015; teardown pending) |
| 0043 | Semantica as a governed extraction worker (pinned fork); SurrealDB exits the critical path | Accepted (2026-08-02; index row backfilled 2026-08-05 — the file shipped without one) |
| 0044 | Evidence-vs-Context boundary + forensic transcript data model | **Accepted** (2026-06-27; merged 2026-08-05, renumbered from ~~0033~~ — `main` had already shipped a different ADR-0033) — **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED by D-069 (2026-08-25 — ingest-time custody for primary evidence reversed)** |
| 0045 | Horizon clocks (visible_from, computed live) + checkpoint-derivation architecture + A.4 realization_event amendment (found-out knowledge in its own table; contradiction events = the lie register); ratifies the six-clock ruling; amends canon §1; closes OQ-1 | **Accepted; A/A.4 superseded in part by ADR-0059** — §B/C remain in force (owner signed 2026-08-09, Option A + A.4; D-042) |
| 0046 | Universal MCP exposure contract: progressive disclosure, annotations, pagination, server-side horizon binding (pays canon §5's "needs ADR") | **Accepted** (owner signed 2026-08-09; D-042) — **SUPERSEDED by D-107 (2026-08-29 — AgentOS MCP door retired)** |
| 0047 | Audit-everything ledger: ops.audit_ledger, hash-chained, append-only, READS included | **Accepted** (owner signed 2026-08-09; D-042) |
| 0048 | Historical Go worker/SBV universal-ingestor decision; streaming decoder assets and messaging-first history survive | **Accepted historical record; superseded in part by ADR-0061 (2026-08-29).** Workbench is the shell/auth/context boundary; SBV is a storage-free preview client. Common Go selection survives, but SBV-owned storage/auth/hashing/orchestration and permanent Python orchestration do not. |
| 0049 | Historical SBV universal-parser/app direction; common Go-selected parser contract survives | **Accepted with 2026-08-12 amendment; superseded in part by ADR-0061 (2026-08-29).** Go-native and governed `platform-tools` adapters share one selection contract; SBV no longer owns the all-in-one app, canonical storage, auth, or custody. UIW context fingerprints are non-custody; evidence H1/H2/H3 begins at promotion and dispatches by exact canon tuple. |
| 0050 | Six-lane knowledge architecture | **Superseded in part by ADR-0053** — storage isolation, evidence boundary, and pg_duckdb/rclone decisions survive; taxonomy is now five lanes |
| 0051 | Parse → asynchronously extract → HITL verify ingest flow | **Superseded in part by ADR-0053** for AI-chat landing/routing/assets; general staged-flow direction survives |
| 0052 | PG-CDC spine (transactional PER-TABLE outbox, trigger-written full rows + NOTIFY wakeup + per-sink cursors — the invariant-4 mechanism), end-to-end AI-chat ingest with coverage-based Go-primary engine split (~~size-based~~ — owner ruling 2026-08-12: Go parses whatever it covers, Python = uncovered formats / logged failure-fallback), and Stage-2 extraction as tools-not-agents (entity_candidate + claim_candidate — ~~artifact_candidate~~ renamed; extract regardless of custody-approval, horizon binds at promotion; dead-letter table + replay + alert; standalone Coolify worker app; Langfuse eval, DSPy deferred) | **ACCEPTED — owner sign-off 2026-08-12** ("sign 52"; all 8 open questions ruled same day, D-054; hands off from ADR-0051 invariant 4; consistent with D-046..D-052; Phase 0 pre-shipped as D-048) — **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED by D-109 (2026-08-29/30 — Q6/`claim_candidate` naming amended)** |
| 0053 | Five-lane AI-chat ingestion; explicit conversation/message/chunk truth; post-chunk multi-label routing; selective confidence HITL; tags; multimodal assets/OCR ladder; human investigation register | **Accepted** — owner rulings 2026-08-13; supersedes 0050/0051/0052 in part |
| 0054 | Mandatory durable run reports + append-only review actions + correlated Agno/OpenTelemetry/Langfuse observability | **Accepted** — owner ruling 2026-08-13; Postgres authoritative, Langfuse diagnostic only; D-059 |
| 0055 | Matter and CourtCase identity boundary + legacy text-partition bridge + idempotent Knowledge-to-Evidence promotion | **Accepted** — owner approval 2026-08-15; narrowly supersedes D-041 identity consequence while retaining single-owner scope; D-060 — **PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED by D-072 (2026-08-25 — multi-proceeding identity consequence narrowed further)** |
| 0056 | SurrealDB governed analytical projection + platform-owned Spectron-compatible walk memory | **Accepted; decision 10 superseded in part by ADR-0059** — owner approval 2026-08-15; remaining governed projection role stands; D-061 |
| 0057 | Claim-centered evidence assembly + immutable established facts with exact multi-source provenance | **Accepted** — owner approval 2026-08-15; D-062 |
| 0058 | Investigation Search + scoped hindsight/as-lived behavioral-analysis modes and internal lens vocabulary | **Accepted** — owner approval 2026-08-15; D-063 |
| 0059 | First-party and acquired-third-party derived message projections; three clocks; resumable checkpoints vs terminal rewalks | **Accepted** — owner ruling 2026-08-18; supersedes ADR-0045 A/A.4 and ADR-0056 decision 10 in part; D-065 |
| 0060 | Maintained Timesketch fork for singleton personal-case timeline; any-context event candidates; PG-authoritative immutable projection generations; individual/bulk round-trip context curation | **Accepted** — owner rulings 2026-08-26; D-084/D-085 |
| 0061 | Unified Workbench shell with SBV as its storage-free pipeline-preview client and bounded Timesketch/Legal surfaces | **Accepted** — owner acceptance and SBV boundary clarification 2026-08-29 |
| 0062 | Claim candidates, temporal edges, and the assertion/synthesis layer; amends ADR-0052 ruling Q6/D-054 (`claim_candidate` naming) | **Accepted** — owner rulings across the 2026-08-29 design session; D-109 |
