implementation, and historical planning. A file describing a target does not prove it is
deployed.

## Current truth in one paragraph

AgentOS is retired from the production API target; the plain FastAPI host and direct-caller cutover
are implemented locally and held for live Coolify proof. Agno 2.8.7 remains only as a disabled,
bounded atomic-agent library dependency while Temporal task contracts are built. Knowledge is ingested once without horizon
restriction; agents later receive immutable, filtered horizon experiences. Semantica is a VIP
service whose findings may be governed candidates. PostgreSQL is authoritative; Graphiti is a
retired adapter, while SurrealDB is the governed manually promoted temporal/walk projection.
Portkey remains preferred routing, OpenCode adds persistent
workspace/provider flexibility. Go routing is
decoder-coverage based at every file size.

ADR-0056–0058 add a governed Surreal analytical/walk-memory target, claim-centered evidence
assembly, Investigation Search, and scoped behavioral analysis. This does not reactivate the
parked legacy Surreal deployment or change PostgreSQL authority. See the goal hierarchy and
technical blueprint above; the new capabilities are design-only.

The Phase-0 review package now defines logical contracts, routes 33 unresolved questions,
specifies the gold corpus/evaluation gates, and adds a 14-test synthetic future-fact canary.
It does not verify live adapters or authorize Phase 1. Six compact owner choices remain pending.

## Held activation

The Matter/CourtCase foundation, migration `0030`, neutral spine APIs,
Workbench adapters/UI, provenance-preserving Knowledge-to-Evidence promotion,
custody inspection, court-readiness read side, and activation preflight are
committed and pushed to `main`. ~~The worktree is clean.~~ **Corrected
2026-08-18 (Claude Code · Fable 5): the worktree is currently DIRTY** — live
`git status` shows uncommitted changes (docs reorg, SurrealDB runner files,
`AGENTS.md`, compose/deploy yaml); see
[OWNER-REVIEW-2026-08-18-verified-todo-audit.md](OWNER-REVIEW-2026-08-18-verified-todo-audit.md)
Part 2. ~~Migrations `0026–0030`
remain unapplied~~ **Corrected 2026-08-23 (Claude Code · Opus 5, CH-15/CH-16): migrations
`0026`–`0030` are APPLIED** to live PG18 (`100.91.190.107:5432`, db `ai`) — `0026`-`0029`
were found already live (stale banners), `0030` was applied the same night on owner
instruction. The **feature** (Matter/CourtCase-aware evidence pipeline, native evidence
vectors) remains undeployed; no live-service proof beyond the applied schema is
claimed. Use the R9 handoff and activation preflight pre-mortem for current
verification and release gates.

Three divergent self-contained Workbench mockups and their evaluation reports
are available through the comparison page above. They are design donors/prototypes, not production
applications. Accepted ADR-0061 defines the production composition: Workbench is the unified shell and
the storage-free SBV client is its bounded `/evidence/preview` pipeline surface.

## Archived lane packets and historical plans

- [R0–R14 packets](awaiting-verification/handoffs/) (pending independent review)

Historical packets, dated plans, inventories, summaries, evaluations, and design history are
archived by category. They remain read-only context and never override current production truth.
