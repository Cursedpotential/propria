## Horizon Swift MVP audit items (2026-08-16)

| Audit item | Observed state | Remaining work / hold |
|---|---|---|
| AgentOS production runtime retirement | **Production-host slice resolved locally (2026-08-29):** plain FastAPI loads zero Agno modules; runtime auth, Workbench direct callers, repair-agent exposure, LibreChat MCP config, OpenCode ops, and activation preflight are cut over to Platform API/Temporal-ready/ContextForge/Portkey boundaries. | **Release hold:** deploy and live-prove exec, Workbench, and branch-scoped LibreChat. Then replace `server/evidence/workflows.py` and Agno Knowledge/provider/vector/session ownership before any code quarantine. |
| Agno-owned ingest | **Resolved for the Swift path:** HTTP, folder-walk, and in-process callers share `server.contracts.ingest` / `server.ingest.service`; public contract tests reject Agno/Graphiti/Surreal/AI-SDK imports. Scratch PostgreSQL received both Markdown and an SBV-covered export. | Legacy Agno workflows remain adapters until their separate retirement wave; no retirement is part of Swift MVP. |
| Empty SBV password silently selects Python | **Resolved on the observed Swift surface:** the live `exec-platform-tools` application has a runtime service credential; a guarded scratch receipt completed through `sbv-go:smsbackuprestore-xml` with fallback disabled. | Any future deployment must keep fail-closed credential checks; no production deployment was changed by this proof. |
| Chonkie absent from production lock/runtime | **Resolved:** `chonkie[semantic,code,table]==1.7.0` is a base dependency; production `requirements.txt` contains no torch/transformers stack. Neutral ingest and Agno reader policies execute Chonkie and record versioned IDs with explicit units. Final scratch proof: Markdown 1 logical record → 3 stored chunks; SBV Go 1 → 1; both `chonkie.recursive@1.7.0:1500-chars`. | Neural/Late/Slumber remain remote-only by D-046; the remote executor and chunk-preview GUI are deferred and must never trigger a local torch install. |
| Workbench canonical source/chunk visibility | **Resolved locally for the Swift operator loop and Data Explorer:** `/intake` submits to neutral `/v1/ingest`; `/knowledge` browse/detail uses neutral `/v1/knowledge/items`, not AgentOS's content catalog. Operators can inspect parser, versioned chunker, SHA-256, normalized records/chunks, temporal/disclosure fields, custody references, and raw attrs, then deep-link into the existing governed attrs-only editor. `/schemas` is now the read-only Data Explorer for all five PostgreSQL schemas with columns, indexes, row counts and bounded row previews, plus Weaviate collection/property/index metadata, object properties, vector dimensions, and short numeric previews. PostgreSQL is labeled canonical; Weaviate search/vectors are labeled projections, not authority. | Full-vector export and arbitrary SQL are intentionally absent; previews are bounded and binary/text cells are encoded or truncated. Live Workbench deployment and observed VPS reads remain owner-gated. |
| Semantica config-only | **Resolved locally at the governed worker boundary:** the framework-neutral immutable-batch contract now executes vendored Semantica pattern NER, relation, and event extraction; emits hash-attested candidate provenance; rejects fabricated adjacency and unresolved event times; and submits only pending rows through an exact `working.extraction_run` / `working.candidate_*` allowlist. The disposable fixture observed 4 entities, 2 facts, 1 event, 2 explicit rejections, and 0 failures. | **Activation held:** the PostgreSQL adapter is contract-tested but no database write, worker deployment, credential provisioning, projection, promotion, or live corpus execution was performed. See `docs/plans/SEMANTICA-SWIFT-SLICE4-2026-08-16.md`. |
| Workbench lacks Vercel AI SDK stream | **Resolved locally:** `ai@7` / `@ai-sdk/react@4` drive `/copilot` through a framework-neutral `POST /v1/chat` plain-text stream. The FastAPI adapter calls Portkey's OpenAI-compatible stream with a required saved fallback config, trace id, and audit metadata; public chat contracts import no Agno/OpenCode/Graphiti/Surreal/AgentOS type. Next production build and the full Workbench API suite pass. | **Activation held:** live Coolify remains healthy on `workbench/sprint`; owner approval plus `PORTKEY_CONFIG`/credential provisioning is required before advancing that branch or redeploying. |
| MCP registry bypass / split gateway | **Resolved in local consumer/config contracts:** ContextForge is the only authored registry; a declarative `source_exact` publication manifest and read-only MCP catalog verifier compare it with Portkey and enforce ADR-0046 annotations. Workbench defaults to zero MCP doors and accepts Portkey entries only; direct doors require an explicit diagnostic bypass. ContextForge compose now requires a dedicated PostgreSQL DSN while preserving SQLite solely for migration/rollback. | **Activation held:** provision a separate PG database/role on ovh-files, migrate and reconcile the SQLite registry, establish a hosted/enterprise Portkey MCP control plane (the OSS LLM gateway is insufficient proof), publish exact virtual servers, provision credentials, produce correlated ContextForge/Portkey/`ops.audit_ledger` traces, then advance/redeploy. |
| Parked Surreal vs new disposable target | **D1/D2 complete; execution held.** The logical slice design, normative pre-mortem, and exact physical proposal are committed; the parked deployment remains denied. | R12 requires separate **D3** target/credential creation authority and **D4** schema/adapter/live-T0 authority. Do not create an adapter, schema, compose overlay, target, or credential until the matching gate is explicitly approved. |
| Agno JSON-metadata evidence vectors | **Native V1 contract accepted locally:** `EvidenceChunkV1` carries typed/range-indexed source clocks and self-provided vectors; static preflight checks the contract and pinned Weaviate >=1.26 without network access. | ~~**Cutover held:** migrations `0026`–`0029`, live collection creation, PG-chunk backfill, exact count/hash/canary receipt, `EvidenceChunks` alias switch, reader rebinding, and deploy each require their release gate.~~ **Corrected 2026-08-23 (Claude Code · Opus 5, CH-15/CH-16):** migrations `0026`–`0029` (plus `0030`) are **APPLIED** — direct introspection of live PG18 (`100.91.190.107:5432`, db `ai`) showed 0026-0029 were already live despite stale "HELD/NOT APPLIED" banners (now restamped in the sql files); 0030 was applied that same night on owner instruction. **Still held:** live collection creation, PG-chunk backfill, exact count/hash/canary receipt, `EvidenceChunks` alias switch, reader rebinding, and deploy each still require their release gate — D-066's activation status is unchanged by the migration correction. Preserve the old Agno evidence collection for rollback. |
| `agno_app` role cutover pending | **Added 2026-08-23 (CH-15):** a non-superuser role `agno_app` was created live on PG18 with `USAGE`/`SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`EXECUTE` across `working`, `evidence`, `ops`, `analysis`, `reference`, `ai`, `public`, `duckdb` (plus default-privilege coverage for future objects), and verified non-superuser by connecting as the role directly (reads/writes OK, `ALTER TABLE` correctly refused as not-owner). | **Not switched over.** The app still connects as the superuser `ai` (`rolsuper=True`, `rolbypassrls=True`, owns all 253 objects), so `sql/0029`'s role-scoping grants remain inert — a superuser bypasses every GRANT. Cutover is an owner action: set `DB_USER`/`DB_PASS` to `agno_app` in Coolify and redeploy (env values bake into the rendered compose; a bare restart will not pick it up). Password was generated, printed once to the session, and deliberately not written to any file. |

## Court-readiness compatibility debt (2026-08-15)

- **Version the custody-event digest writer/verifier.** The existing trigger hashes a
  session-timezone-rendered timestamp without recording a construction/timezone version.
  The read-only Matter readiness endpoint safely verifies 2026-era rows by testing the
  complete modern civil-offset grid (105 candidates per event), and the rollback harness
  proves UTC/New_York reader invariance. This bounded compatibility path is acceptable for
  an explicit operator read, but it must not become a high-volume query primitive. Add a
  canonical UTC/versioned construction for new events, reconcile/cache legacy verification,
  and benchmark representative large source chains before activation at scale. Do not
  rewrite or delete historical custody rows.

## Report re-verification corrections (2026-08-14)

Source: an independent review report (`docs/reports/mcp-platform-agno-review.md`, Perplexity-sourced,
**kept local/untracked** — findings folded into existing registers here, not committed as a report).
Re-verified against source at commit `5d3fb09` (10 parallel verifiers + smart-explore contradiction sweep).
Two report claims are **REFUTED** and recorded here so they don't re-enter the project as open items:

1. **Report §45 "disclosure_tier hardcode = bug per ADR-0045" — REFUTED (most-wrong finding).**
   ADR-0045 Decision C / N3 says the parser hardcoding of `disclosure_tier=contemporaneous`
   (`server/tools/parsers/messaging/sbv_sms.py:114`, `server/analysis/sbv_transcript.py:111`) is
   **CORRECT** — "extraction cannot know better; the defect is that no derivation layer exists above
   it." The real defect is the **unbuilt derivation/horizon layer** (INVENTORY N1: predicate filters
   on superseded `knowledge_time`; N2: `realized_at`/`acquired_at` zero writers; FD: agent-layer
   pre-filter unbuilt) — NOT the hardcode. Removing the hardcode would CONTRADICT ADR-0045 Decision C.
   The hardcode that WAS reversed (correctly) was the AI-chat **context** lane (sql/0023 / D-056,
   applied) — a different lane from evidence extraction. The report also misnames the file
   (`sbv_sms.py:114`, not `sbv_transcript.py`). Wave 1 builds the derivation layer; the hardcode stays.

2. **Report Addendum A2 "derived horizon tables need a new ADR" — REFUTED.** ADR-0045 §B (signed
   2026-08-09, D-042) already **sanctions version-pinned DERIVED pass materializations** (as-lived
   incremental via `working.walk_ledger` + hindsight on-prompt; single-writer refresher; hash-attested
   to `ops.audit_ledger`) and **amends canon §1** (parallel AUTHORED as-lived/hindsight stores
   FORBIDDEN). No new ADR is needed — the work is to BUILD the already-sanctioned design (Wave 1/3).
   Canon §1 + §3 amended 2026-08-14 to state this (see `PROJECT_CANON.md`).

The remaining report GAPs (GAP-01…GAP-12) were CONFIRMED or PARTIAL against source and are tracked
in the existing rows above / the Wave plan (`C:\Users\matts\.claude\plans\cached-waddling-crayon.md`).
Full re-verification verdict table lives in that plan.

## Wave 0 live inventory findings (2026-08-14)

Source: `scripts/_wave0_inventory.py` + `scripts/_wave0_fresh_restore.py` against tailnet PG
`100.91.190.107:5432` db `ai` (PG 18.1). Full signed baseline:
`docs/INVENTORY-BASELINE-2026-08-14.md`.

1. **Horizon predicate = superseded `knowledge_time` (LIVE-CONFIRMED), and the held replacement
   now also needs ADR-0059 conformance.** `working.horizon_visible` still filters on
   `row_knowledge_time <= p_horizon`, so the live predicate is inert. ADR-0059 supersedes the
   proposed universal realization/occurrence replacement: first-party source availability equals
   occurrence; acquired-third-party availability equals acquisition; realization stays plural.
   Wave 1 must implement that source-class predicate and dedicated derived projections before any
   reader activation. This remains GAP-04 / INVENTORY N1, sharpened to “live-verified and
   superseded-design-aware.”

2. **ADR-0045 §B plus ADR-0059 derivation/lifecycle contracts are unbuilt live:** the current
   database has no active plural realization/source-availability derivation, dedicated acquired-
   third-party projection, durable healthy checkpoint/resume path, or terminal seal/linked-rewalk
   path. The local disposable implementation is not production activation. Wave 1 remains held.

3. **ADR-0053 schema BUILT but EMPTY** (live-confirmed): `chat_conversation`/`chat_message`/
   `chat_chunk` (+ lane/embedding/projection) exist, 0 rows; `chat_cdc_cursor` +
   `chat_projection_dead_letter` exist, 0 rows. `working.context_record` still holds **1,741
   rows** — the legacy chat-lane data to migrate into the new tables per ADR-0053.

4. **PARTIALLY RESOLVED — bootstrap captured; current-image replay still drifts.** Commit
   `2b37a4b` added `sql/bootstrap/schema_baseline.sql`, so the earlier action to locate and
   capture the out-of-band DDL is complete. A 2026-08-16 observed restore into the isolated
   `horizon_scratch` PostgreSQL service exposed two remaining defects:
   (a) the dump creates `pg_duckdb` before `pg_stat_statements` and PostGIS, causing the current
   `ghcr.io/cursedpotential/agno-postgres` image to reject their extension-script `GRANT`s as
   MotherDuck-table operations; pre-creating every conventional extension before `pg_duckdb`
   made the structure-only restore succeed; and (b) the captured file does not contain
   `ops.audit_ledger` even though `sql/README.md` said it did. Applying `0019`–`0020`, then
   `0021`–`0030` in reviewed order completed the scratch schema. **Still open:** regenerate or
   wrap the baseline with deterministic extension ordering, an explicit included-migration
   manifest, and an empty-database regression test. Do not call the baseline alone a verified
   current-image bootstrap until that gate passes.

**Rule:** No code ships incomplete-and-silent. Any unavoidable stub gets a
grep-able `# STUB:` marker in code AND a row here. **Scope: non-test code only**
(`server/`, `docker/`, `evals/`, `scripts/`) — `grep -rn "# STUB:" server docker
evals scripts` must match this table exactly. Keep this current as part of
every change. Test doubles (fake engines, stub clients, etc. used *by* tests
to isolate a unit) are a different thing — mark those `# TEST-DOUBLE:` in
`tests/`, not `# STUB:`; they don't belong in this register because they are
never incomplete-and-silent in production, they're deliberate test fixtures
(corrected 2026-08-09 — `tests/test_run_ledger.py:61` and
`tests/test_custody.py:19` were mistagged `# STUB:` and re-tagged
`# TEST-DOUBLE:` for exactly this reason).

## Known debt (tracked, scheduled in the plan)

| Item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Backend atomic tools (parsers/extractors) attached | **resolved 2026-07-10** — real chatminer-backed parsers exist under `server/tools/parsers/{messaging,ai_chat,generic}/` + `server/tools/extractors/`, registry populated | P2 — `server/tools/registry.py` |

## Agno-native audit (2026-06-11) — STOP reinventing; use native (no code written yet)

~~Pinned `agno==2.6.9`; latest is 2.6.13~~ — **corrected 2026-08-09: `requirements.txt` currently
pins `agno==2.8.7`** (verified by grep against the live file; not the `2.8.0` other docs — AGENTS.md,
CONVENTIONS.md, canon §8 — still cite as current, itself a drift this pass did not chase down
further; flag for a follow-up sync). Audit below was verified against the 2.6.9 wheel + skill
references at the time it was written and has not been re-run against 2.8.7; treat the specific
API surfaces named as needing re-verification, not as stale in spirit. **Reinvented /
about-to-reinvent things Agno provides natively — switch before building P1–P5:**

| We built/planned | Native Agno (use this instead) |
|---|---|
| Custom `approval_request` table + `/v1/approval-requests` routes | `@approval(type="required")` decorator (`agno.approval.decorator`) + auto-mounted **`/approvals`** router (list/resolve/count/status/delete) + `PostgresDb.create_approval/get_approvals/update_approval` + agents `/continue` w/ `require_approval_resolved`. **Recorded, queryable, blocking approval — exactly our HITL intent. DROP the custom table+routes.** |
| Domain-separated knowledge via custom per-domain plumbing (ADR-0020) | `knowledge_filters` + `enable_agentic_knowledge_filters` on Agent. **Dict filters ONLY on Weaviate** (the locked platform vector substrate, ADR-0040) — `Knowledge.search(filters={"domain": "legal_strategy", "disclosure_tier": ...})`. Corrected 2026-08-09: ~~`Knowledge.search(filters=[EQ("domain","legal_strategy")])` (`agno.filters` `FilterExpr` list)~~ — agno's Weaviate adapter SILENTLY DROPS `FilterExpr` lists (`log_warning` + `filters=None`); source = `AGENTS.md`'s own Weaviate-specific landmine paragraph ("verified in agno 2.8.0 source, 2026-08-02"), not `docs/reference/agno-memory-and-storage/02-knowledge-and-retrieval.md:1195` (that push-down table documents Milvus, a different adapter with different filter support). Metadata tags + dict filters; agents can pick dict filter *values* agentically (`enable_agentic_knowledge_filters`), never a `FilterExpr`. |
| Custom DAG executor for evidence workflows (ADR-0017) | `agno.workflow` `Step/Steps/Parallel/Condition/Loop/Router`. **Router = agent re-composition on failure; Loop = retry; Condition = branch; `Step(executor=fn)` = arbitrary code.** Registry can stay; orchestration is native. |
| Bespoke tool registry / `tools-facade` | `Toolkit` (`agno.tools.toolkit`) + `MCPToolbox` (`agno.tools.mcp`, DB-fleet tool filtering). Atomic tools = Toolkits/MCP. |
| Custom eval harness (P5) | `agno.eval`: `AccuracyEval`, `AgentAsJudgeEval`, `ReliabilityEval` (tool-call assertions), `PerformanceEval`. |

**Justified custom (NO native equivalent — keep):** `db/embedder.py` NimEmbedder (no native NVIDIA
embedder; query/passage), `db/reranker.py` NvidiaReranker (no native NVIDIA reranker; Cohere leaks).
(Now `server/core/embedder.py` / `server/core/reranker.py` — ADR-0033 `db/` → `server/core/`.)
Added 2026-08-09: the **checkpoint-derivation engine** (ADR-0045, Decision B) — the sole
grant-locked refresher that materializes version-pinned derived-pass checkpoints from the one
canonical factual store, one predicate, two schedules (as-lived incremental / hindsight
on-prompt), every derivation hash-attested to `ops.audit_ledger`. No Agno-native equivalent
exists for version-pinned, hash-attested, single-writer derivation of bitemporal knowledge-horizon
checkpoints — this is the platform's own knowledge-horizon mechanism (`AGENTS.md` §"WHY THIS
EXISTS"), not a generic capability an off-the-shelf component provides.

**Under-used native worth adopting:** `output_schema` (Pydantic) for normalized/analysis records;
`tool_hooks` for custody/audit wrapping; native Knowledge readers/chunkers for ingestion.

**Action:** ~~upgrade to 2.6.13~~ ✅ — ~~rewrite P1 to native `@approval` + `/approvals`~~ ✅ (2026-06-12);
base P2/P3 workflows on native Workflow; P5 evals on `agno.eval`. Updates ADR-0017/0020/0021.

## Resolved (kept for provenance)

| Item | Resolution | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding query/passage mismatch | `db/embedder.py` NimEmbedder — passage default, query-path override | 2026-06-11 |
| Ephemeral pg_duckdb R2 secret | `ensure_duckdb_r2_secret()` runs at API startup (survives DB recreate) | 2026-06-11 |
| HITL row persist + decision→continue (P1) | NATIVE: agno upgraded 2.6.9→2.6.13; `apply_db_modification` = `@approval` + `@tool(requires_confirmation=True)` — pause persists a pending row (`agno.run.approval`), `POST /approvals/{id}/resolve` records the decision, run-continue is gated by `require_approval_resolved`. Custom `approval_request` table+routes removed (`app/main.py`); legacy tables marked in `sql/0002_schema.sql` | 2026-06-12 |
| `apply_db_modification` was `NotImplementedError` | Real write: executes ONE statement against an allowlisted schema (`DB_WRITE_SCHEMAS` env, default `analysis`; `evidence` hard-denied regardless of config), search_path pinned to the validated target, rejects `evidence.*` references, rolls back on error (`agents/factory.py`; allowlist added 2026-07-29) | 2026-06-12 |
| `trash_cloud_file` stub + Cloud Drive Cleanup agent | Removed from active topology entirely (owner decision) — separate future feature | 2026-06-12 |

## Parser-lane follow-ups (from the 2026-08-02 gap review — owner: "ensure these go on a list")

Source: docs/HANDOFF-2026-08-02-sbv-chatminer-parser-gap-review.md (phases + acceptance criteria there).

0. **ADR-0044 §4 blob ban is UNENFORCED in code (found 2026-08-10 pre-mortem sweep; assign to
   S7's registry/contract task).** `transcripts.markdown`
   (`server/tools/parsers/generic/whole_file_fallback.py:25`) registers plain
   `capability="parse.transcript"`, so the whole-file speaker-blending fallback is resolvable
   by `build_chat_transcript_workflow.parse_step` (`server/evidence/workflows.py:533`) — a
   workflow that runs custody + store steps. ADR-0044 says the whole-file parser is
   "last resort only and BANNED for evidence." Fix options, decide inside S7 (the right gate
   depends on the chat-transcript workflow's lane semantics, which S7 owns): (a) capability
   split — fallback moves to `parse.context_transcript`, context lane
   (`server/analysis/context_chat_ingest.py:118`) resolves both, evidence workflows resolve
   only `parse.transcript`; or (b) store-boundary guard — evidence/store rejects records whose
   `parser_id == "transcripts.markdown"` (ban enforced where the harm happens). Either way add
   the guard TEST: fail if `transcripts.markdown` is reachable from an evidence-lane workflow.

0b. **Python SMS-XML parser must go iterative and spill to a FILE, not memory (owner directive,
   2026-08-10: "the python sms parser still needs to be fixed at some point — it's supposed to be
   iterative and it's supposed to write directly to a file and not into memory … even though it's
   a backup").** Two distinct defects in
   `server/tools/parsers/messaging/sms_xml.py`:

   - **(i) Records accumulate in memory even on the happy path.** `_collect()` (`:279`) streams the
     *XML* correctly — `iterparse` + `elem.clear()` — but appends every record to an `out` list.
     `parse()` (`:311`) then hands that whole list to `records_out()` (`:321`). Memory scales with
     record count, not file size. **The streaming generator already exists** — `iter_records()`
     (`:238`) yields, and its docstring says it exists "so a caller can batch straight into the raw
     layer with flat memory." `parse()` simply does not use it.
   - **(ii) The malformed-XML fallback is the worst case.** `:291-301` does
     `ET.fromstring(_sanitize_xml(path.read_text(...)))` — the whole file as a string *plus* a full
     DOM. The code already admits it: the inline comment says "more RAM, last resort," and
     `iter_records`' own docstring (`:252-255`) calls it "exactly what streaming exists to avoid …
     rather than silently ballooning to multi-GB."

   **Required shape:** `parse()` drives `iter_records()` and writes records straight to a file
   (NDJSON spill), returning a path + counts rather than an inline list. The malformed path must
   sanitize incrementally instead of materializing the document.

   **Contract implication — do not skip.** `records_out()` returns records inline, so a spill-to-file
   mode changes the atomic tool's output contract. Per ADR-0049 the tool must stay callable **both**
   in a workflow **and** atomically over the API, so both callers need to handle the new shape.

   **This is NOT closed by the ADR-0049 routing fix.** Routing sends normal traffic to the Go
   `smsXMLImporter`; this parser remains the fallback, and a fallback that exhausts memory is not a
   real fallback. **Unverified, check before assuming otherwise:** whether the Go decoder handles
   *malformed* dumps at all — its `Detect` only requires `.xml` plus `<smses`/`<calls` in the head,
   so it may accept a malformed file and fail differently. If Go cannot repair them, this Python
   path is load-bearing rather than a backup. rel: ADR-0049 (memory criterion), owner statement
   "go is critical for files that could blow out a memory store".

1. ~~**Go-side import-scoping (review Phase 1):** SBV upload returns
   `{job_id, import_id}`; messages/calls carry import_id; add
   `GET /api/imports/:id/activity`; bind progress + hashes to the same id;
   custody reconciliation becomes mandatory for the forensic tier. This is the
   restore condition for the 2026-08-02 SBV demotion (DECISION_LOG).~~
   **LANDED — PR #18 (`aacf21c`, merged 2026-08-06).** `server/tools/_sbv_client.py`
   is import-scoped throughout (`import_id` on `import_detail`/`import_records`/
   `import_rejections`/`import_attachments`/`hashes`, verified 2026-08-09).
   This is the basis for **SBV's promotion back to primary** (owner directive
   2026-08-05; D-040, `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`).
2. **Streaming/batch ingestion contract (review Phase 2) — PARTIAL, open item
   tracked in S7:** the **SBV path** now has its own import-scoped
   reconciliation (item 1, landed) — but the **generic/cross-parser**
   contract this row originally scoped is still open: iterator/batch parser
   protocol with backpressure; a real `evidence.raw_rejected` WRITER (the
   table + indexes exist since sql/0012 and `server/tools/parsers/messaging/
   sms_xml.py` + `server/tools/repair/types.py` reference the table by name,
   but no code path currently `INSERT`s into it — verified 2026-08-09, zero
   writers found); `record_count_claimed` capture; claimed = accepted +
   rejected + accounted-duplicate gate; replace the in-memory multipart
   upload for non-SBV parsers.
3. **Registry priority/quality metadata (review Phase 3) — open, S7:** explicit
   `priority` / `quality_tier` / `streaming` / `custody_capabilities` /
   `max_safe_size` on the tool contract; golden corpora per format;
   primary/fallback equivalence tests; SBV shadow-comparison harness.
4. **ChatMiner hardening (review Phase 4) — open, S7:** rename `message_hash` →
   `content_fingerprint` (full digest, never custody); deterministic IDs from
   (artifact H1, parser version, source indices); tz-aware UTC timestamps;
   bounded detection probes instead of whole-file reads.
5. **Repair-layer wiring — open, S7:** adopt `server/tools/repair/` one format
   at a time (SMS XML first, then CSV) only AFTER the ledger/rejection/
   reconciliation writers of item 2 exist — the observability contract is the
   acceptance criterion. Coordinate with the repair-layer chat (their branch:
   feat/stream-repair-layer — landed in part via PR #18's governed repair
   slice, item 1 above; item 2's generic writer is still the gate for
   adopting `server/tools/repair/` beyond SBV).

## Derive route: unapplied execution_path schema change (2026-09-20)

_Byline: Claude Code · Opus 5 · 2026-09-20._

| Item | Observed state | Remaining work / hold |
|---|---|---|
| `context.handler_compatibility.execution_path` does not admit `'derive'` | The CHECK on the live database reads `('decoder','duckdb')` — verified read-only on 2026-09-20 as `platform_runtime` against `platform` on ovh-files. `sql/bootstrap/schema_snapshot_20260907.sql` has been widened to `('decoder','duckdb','derive')`, and `scripts/2026-09-20-derive-execution-path.sql` is the idempotent equivalent for a live database. **Neither has been applied.** | **BLOCKER, owner action.** Until the script is applied (or the database is rebuilt from the snapshot), `recommend_handler_activity` fails on the INSERT into `context.handler_compatibility` for every `smsbackuprestore_xml` source, because routing now emits the `derive` path. Apply it before starting any SMS-XML run. |
| `derive_structured_text_activity` has no live receipt | The Activity, stage, routing, worker wiring and tests are committed on `feat/derive-sms-activity`. Nothing was deployed and no workflow was started. The underlying unit was live-proven standalone on 2026-09-20 (584 MB backup → 12,389 records, 132 chunks, 564 media objects, 4m27s, ~80 MB memory), but the Activity boundary around it has only been proven against an in-memory object store. | Deploy, apply the schema change, run one real `smsbackuprestore_xml` source end to end, and record the receipt. |
| Derived chunks are not yet ingested automatically | The derive route ENDS the parent run with the derived manifest reference and bounded chunk references. Each chunk must currently be submitted as its own `ndjson` Proffer run by hand. | Implement the child-workflow fan-out (no `ExecuteChildWorkflow` exists anywhere in `modules/engine` today, so it is a new pattern and a separate design decision), or an explicit operator action in the Workbench that submits the manifest's chunks. |
