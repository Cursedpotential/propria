"""Live smoke test for the forensic stores — RUN WHERE THE TAILNET IS REACHABLE
(the owner's desktop or a VPS shell; the cloud sandbox cannot reach these).

    python scripts/smoke_forensic_stores.py

Fail-soft: every section prints PASS / FAIL / SKIP and the script exits nonzero
only if a reachable service actively failed (unreachable = SKIP, since which
services exist depends on where you run it). READ-ONLY throughout: dry-run
plans, SELECT counts, list_collections — no writes, no collection creation.

Sections:
  PG        ontology counts (0006 seed: behavior_category / detection_pattern /
            pattern_lexicon / behavior_category_mcl), evidence.source presence,
            detection.run(dry_run=True, limit=50) against real records
  MILVUS    LEGACY lane (ADR-0040: Milvus sidelined — memsearch only, no new
            platform writers): connect, list_collections, diff vs plan. Kept for
            the Milvus->Weaviate export; a smoke_weaviate() section is the
            follow-up once the Phase-1 cutover lands.
  WIRING    semantica_wiring.full_wiring() renders (no secret values printed)
