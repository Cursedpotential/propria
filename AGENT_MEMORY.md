# Repository Agent Memory

> **Owner directive, 2026-09-24 07:18–07:20 (Claude Code · Opus 5.5).** ~~Any processing … is kept and propagated,
> never redone.~~ *Corrected 07:20 (owner: "a bit strong for what I said").* **Don't throw away work we'd have to do
> again.** Be efficient: carry usable work products from one task into the next, and look ahead to what later stages
> will need. Ad-hoc SQL over the catalog is often exactly that work (extraction, normalization, sender/direction
> fixes, deduplication, chunking, labels), so build it into the catalog and fill the platform tables from there later
> (owner: "keep it in a temp table for the moment"; "build it into the catalog and then we can extract it from the
> catalog into the tables"). Record the target beside each staged result. First register:
> `docs/handoffs/JEV-EVAL-OPTIONS-2026-09-23.md` § "Propagation register".

> _Byline: Codex · GPT-5 · 2026-08-27; navigation verification refreshed 2026-08-29._
> _Byline: Claude Code · Fable 5.1 · 2026-09-05 — naming canon sweep D-137..D-141; no UIW/proffer rows existed in this router. See `docs/NAMING.md`._

This file is a router, not an encyclopedia. Read only the branches relevant to the current task.

## Durable owner preferences

- **Owner directive:** lead with the result, use labeled sections and plain English, and use an
  HTML/diagram/table when complex relationships materially benefit from a visual surface.
- **Owner directive:** finish one functional vertical slice before adding another feature; never
  substitute an unapproved surface or disconnected stub without explicit disclosure.
- **Owner directive:** persist material findings, decisions, implementation, and verification in
  project documentation; chat-only results are not a handoff.
- **Owner directive:** preserve concurrent work, use bounded ownership, and never hard-delete.
- **Owner directive:** edit and validate source in this checkout; commit and push; Coolify builds
  and deploys on the VPS. Do not create a duplicate local infrastructure stack.

## Current cross-tree corrections

- SurrealDB remains the governed temporal-graph, walk, and analysis target. Only the retired legacy
  operational adapter/instance is parked. See `AGENTS.md` and ADR-0056.
- LanceDB is not part of the current platform stack. **Milvus = memsearch only; Weaviate =
  project vector store projection** (owner ruling 2026-09-03): the Milvus service
  (`100.91.190.107:19530`) is UP and is memsearch's live backend — never say "Milvus is
  down." See `AGENTS.md`.
- PostgreSQL remains canonical. Timesketch, search, graph, RAG, and operator surfaces are governed
  views or projections, not replacement authority.

## Repository boundary router

- ~~Canonical repository checkout: `E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Probata/probata`.~~
  **Corrected 2026-09-26 (Claude Code · Opus 5.5):** `E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/modules/Probata/probata`
  since 2026-09-20, a module of the Propria monorepo. The "Current checkout routing" table in the
  Propria root `AGENTS.md` is the one place current paths are kept.
- Repository status: separate child Git repository pending controlled Propria monorepo import.
- Canonical linked-worktree root: `E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/_worktrees/`.
- Codex-managed exception: `C:/Users/matts/.codex/worktrees/`.
- Consignatio authority: `E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Consignatio`; read its own routers
  before Consignatio work and do not treat this Probata repository as its authority.

## Geo lane is PARKED (D-121, 2026-08-31) — note for every future session
The location/GPS lane (stay_point, gps_track, geocode_*, home_base,
waypoint_device_split, vehicle, geofence, geocode_audit) is REAL, owner-ruled,
and deliberately OUT of the live database until ingest is proven on lesser
data. Complete one-file restore: `sql/parked/geo_lane_parked_20260831.sql`
(restore-proven against a clean target). Do NOT recreate these ad hoc; do NOT
treat their absence as a gap. Owner: "why am I gonna bring in the key to the
application I've been working on even longer than this, just to have it
fucked up too."

## Git on this repo
~~Desktop Commander ONLY~~ **Corrected 2026-09-01 (owner):** sessions with real
shell access (Claude Code desktop) run git directly. The DC-only rule applied
only to sandboxed Local-Agent-Mode sessions that could not unlink .git locks or
push (proven 2026-08-31, commit 15a1d87). Use DC only from such a sandbox.
