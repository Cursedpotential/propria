# D03 OCR literal verification receipt

**Acceptance link:** `AC-W-W19`, `D03-C01` (bounded image search slice).
**Implementation source:** `codex/d03-ocr-literal-20260923` from Consignatio `main@0d002d46c3440a37655ecef17acab14688fbab0b`.
**Review branch:** `codex/d03-ocr-literal-pr-20260923`, with only the D03 commit transplanted onto remote `main@b2be221de35a846fe023df934d46170108c79b50`. The two unpublished local `main` commits are excluded.
**Scope:** `Intake/backend/src/casebible_index/image_search.py` and its focused tests. The source catalog, index, source files, and evidence records were not changed.

## Implemented

The image searcher treats Weaviate BM25 output as candidates. It returns an `ocr_literal` hit only when the query is a substring of retained `ocr_text` after Unicode NFC normalization, case folding, and collapsing Unicode whitespace. Punctuation remains significant; substring matching can occur within a word. The result gives the original OCR text's zero-based, end-exclusive character offsets and a nearby excerpt. It preserves `object_id`, `source_id`, `source_path`, and `content_sha256` so byte-identical occurrences remain separate results.

Single-vector and MaxSim candidates remain `visual_similarity` hits, even when their OCR field happens to contain the query. Their scores are labeled by basis and are ranked within a separate channel. No OCR span is asserted for a vector-only result. All hits report `region_status=not_recorded`; the current image index does not persist region coordinates. A BM25 candidate without a verified phrase is excluded from the literal result set. The configured result limit still bounds retrieval, so a miss does not prove absence from the source or full index.

## Reproducible checks

- `tests/test_image_search_literal.py`: four synthetic tests cover Unicode/whitespace offsets, two distinct paths with one content hash, BM25 false positives, semantic-only/vector-only results, and a long verified phrase that remains visible in the excerpt. `4 passed`.
- Focused integration with the existing occurrence fixture and filesystem API: `21 passed`.
- Full `Intake/backend` Python suite from the isolated D03 worktree: `111 passed, 2 dependency deprecation warnings`.
- Full `Intake/backend` Python suite rerun on the final review base: `123 passed, 2 dependency deprecation warnings`. Ruff and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` passed there.
- Ruff on the changed source and test: passed. `git diff --check`: passed.
- Official Gitleaks `8.30.0` Windows x64 release asset checksum matched the published SHA-256 `54fe94f644b832dd08e8c3a5915efb3bfa862386d59fb27ca0792cb687a83573`. `gitleaks dir --redact=100` over `Intake/backend`: about 1.59 MB scanned, no leaks found. Redacted report stored outside the branch under `E:\AI_Workspace\Projects\Propria\_worktrees\d03-temp\gitleaks-backend-dir-final.json`.
- The same official binary scanned the transplanted D03 code commit before this receipt update using `gitleaks git --redact=100 --log-opts=origin/main..HEAD`: one commit, about 11.80 KB, no leaks found. Redacted report is outside the branch at `E:\AI_Workspace\Projects\Propria\_worktrees\d03-temp\gitleaks-d03-commit.json`.
- Read-only occurrence fixture: `tests/fixtures/occurrences/store-a/note.txt` and `store-b/note.txt` have the same SHA-256 `342517e5e37df307faf82dac660c75df686b4f5904692218ca7557efee858b83`; the existing `test_occurrence_identity.py` asserts that these retain distinct occurrences. This fixture proves occurrence semantics, not image OCR accuracy.

## Open acceptance boundaries

This slice has no live corpus or deployed index proof. D02's authoritative occurrence/version/member/open locator is not yet in the image result contract; `source_id` plus relative `source_path` is provisional provenance and cannot alone authorize source opening. OCR regions are not generated or stored here, so no region is highlighted. Coverage, index freshness, partial failure/recovery, native and browser opening, and Process linkage remain separate D03/D12 acceptance work. A successful search query is not an index-completeness receipt, and nothing here accepts or promotes evidence.

## Independent review — 2026-09-23

An independent reviewer checked the exact PR head `df40c01dd66cd69102885ec76478a70990d4f21a` in a separate clean worktree. Review found one NFC false negative: conjoining Hangul Jamo have combining class zero, so the first implementation split a canonically composable sequence and missed a composed query. The matcher now keeps any full source sequence whose next character composes under NFC, including three-character Hangul syllables. A regression also checks reordered combining marks and verifies that returned offsets slice the retained OCR characters. The response explicitly reports `locator_status=provisional`; `source_path` is provenance only.

The reviewer confirmed that the image index assigns object identity from `source_id` plus relative source path, and the search merge key is the object ID. Two byte-identical occurrences can therefore remain distinct. BM25 rows without the normalized phrase are rejected; vector-only rows retain `visual_similarity` even when their attached OCR text includes the phrase. No OCR region or authorized reopen locator is fabricated. Search misses remain inconclusive because Weaviate candidate retrieval and the response limit are bounded.

After the review patch, the full backend suite passed with `124 passed, 2 dependency deprecation warnings`; all five focused literal-search tests passed. Ruff passed on the two changed Python files and `git diff --check` passed. A broad Ruff check also reported five findings in `api.py` and `test_lookup_and_lake.py`, both outside this PR; no broad formatting or repair was applied.

The reviewer independently downloaded the official Gitleaks 8.30.0 checksum file from `gitleaks/gitleaks` and confirmed the Windows release archive SHA-256 above, then verified the binary reports `8.30.0`. Redacted scans of the backend `src`, `tests`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` found no leaks; a redacted Git scan of the three PR commits through review patch `8c761e9` found no leaks. An initial full-directory scan included the review worktree's generated `.venv` and reported 11 generic-key patterns, all in third-party NumPy/PyArrow files under `.venv`; no repository-owned file was involved. Redacted reports are under `E:\AI_Workspace\Projects\Propria\_worktrees\d03-temp\`. Final PR/merge results are recorded by the integration gate separately.
