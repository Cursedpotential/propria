-- Chat DIRECTORY map (owner 2026-09-18 20:02 EDT: "scan the directories and make an attempt to identify
-- the chat directories and index those first"). Supersedes the file-by-format candidate ordering of
-- comm_candidates_20260918.sql for indexing order; that table is still used as one of the inputs.
--
-- Catalog only (no re-scan): original paths from raw_duck.intake_catalog_fs_20260917 (rel / parent / name),
-- current B2 vault = raw_duck.vault_objects_20260916_r4 minus raw_duck.vault_onecopy_pilot_delete_20260916.
-- A directory is the catalog `parent` (original folder). A chat directory is one that holds a chat
-- candidate, or whose path names chats/messages/Messenger/inbox/SMS/texts/iMessage/WhatsApp/Voice/Hangouts/
-- Communication/Phone Records/Comms/Phone Data/Court/Takeout/facebook-*/meta-* or the person (Katrina/Kinzel).
--
-- Priority (owner 20:02 + owner priority folders 20:07):
--   1 path contains katrina|kinzel
--   2 owner priority folders: Comms/Communications, Phone Data, Court, Communication Data, SMS
--   3 directories that already produced Katrina events (raw_duck.comm_event_provenance_20260918)
--   4 Phone Records / Messages / iMessage / texts / WhatsApp / chats
--   5 Facebook / Messenger exports
--   6 Google Takeout Voice / Chat / Mail / Hangouts
--   7 AI chats
--   8 the rest
-- Cube ACR folders are audio: only their .json metadata is readable (call log), no transcription.
-- Person names beyond the owner-authorised directory keywords are NOT written here.
--
-- Run: docker exec -i fgz1n7useplhk0t91uk7k1aw psql -U postgres -d casebible -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < comm_directories_20260918.sql
