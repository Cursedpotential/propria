-- 0016_working_gate_layer.sql — the extraction gate inside `working`:
-- machine candidates, human review, labelled promotion.

-- NB 2026-08-12: routing targets below reference SurrealDB as the downstream
-- analysis sink per applied sql/0016; SurrealDB is RETIRED (2026-08-06,
-- ADR-0043). This validator mirrors APPLIED HISTORY — do not read the
-- 'surrealdb' lane targets as current routing.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ===============
-- Owner ruling 2026-08-01: "there's gonna be raw, then there's going to be
-- working tables, and then there's going to be the gated evidence."
--
-- HISTORY OF THIS FILE: drafted 2026-08-01 as `0008_working_schema.sql`, before
-- sql/0014 split the old `analysis` schema and CREATED `working` (spine,
-- projections, links, resolved entities). That made this draft's number collide
-- with the applied 0008_temporal_clocks_and_provenance.sql and its premise
-- ("nothing between raw and court-facing") stale. Renumbered to 0016 and
-- adapted 2026-08-02; the DESIGN is unchanged. DEPENDS ON 0014 having run.
--
-- The layout this migration lands in:
--
--   evidence.raw_*   as-ingested, immutable        (raw_sms alone holds 14,107 rows)
--   working.*        derived working set (0014):   spine normalized_record,
--                    projections, links, resolved entities — plus, from THIS
--                    migration, the extraction gate below
--   analysis.*       human-gated conclusions only  (findings, labels, decisions)
--   reference.*      hand-curated taxonomy
--
-- Anything an LLM or NER pass inferred must be HUMAN-APPROVED before it can be
-- cited. Extractors write CANDIDATES here. A review pass approves, rejects, or
-- supersedes them. Only approved rows are promoted — into the resolved
-- `working.*` entity tables, the gated `analysis.*` conclusions, and onward to
-- SurrealDB / the Semantica graph / Graphiti, each crossing labelled by lane.
--
-- SUPERSEDES (structurally, not by deletion): `working.extraction_candidate`
-- and `working.record_observation` — the 0014-era staging placeholders, both
-- verified 0 rows live on 2026-08-02. They stay in place per the never-delete
-- rule; the candidate_* family below is the richer replacement. COMMENTs are
-- stamped on them at the end of this file.
--
-- DESIGN NOTES
-- ------------
-- * Additive only. This migration creates a NEW schema and touches nothing in
--   evidence.* or analysis.*. It cannot affect existing data.
-- * Provenance is mandatory, not optional: every candidate carries the raw
--   table + row it came from, and the extraction run that produced it. A
--   candidate that cannot be traced back to source is not admissible, so the
--   columns are NOT NULL rather than nullable-and-hopefully-populated.
-- * review_state is TEXT + CHECK, not an ENUM: review vocabularies are business
--   logic and evolve; altering an enum in place is a migration hazard.
-- * uuidv7() (native in PG18) gives time-ordered keys — candidates from one
--   extraction run cluster on disk, which is exactly the access pattern the
--   review UI has (fetch a run's pending items).
-- * Timeline validity uses tstzrange + GiST so "what did we believe was true
--   as of date X" is answerable, and overlapping claims are detectable.
--
-- THE TWO PASSES (owner design, 2026-08-01 14:20-14:34)
-- ----------------------------------------------------
-- Crossing the gate is not one destination. Owner: "there's the strictly as-it-
-- happened analysis that doesn't have the hindsight that is the human
-- experience, and then there's the hindsight analysis that shows the
-- manipulation and the lies and the deceit and what really happened."
--
--   as_lived      Graphiti      keyed on realized_at    what you BELIEVED, when
--   hindsight     Semantica/Neo4j keyed on occurred_at  what was ACTUALLY true
--   consolidated  SurrealDB     keyed on the DELTA      where manipulation worked
--
-- The routing rule is load-bearing and counter-intuitive: the as-lived lane is
-- keyed on realized_at, NOT on acquisition. You can hold a file for two years
-- without reading it; your belief state changed when you understood it, not
-- when the bytes arrived. Injecting late-acquired knowledge into the as-lived
-- record erases the belief state, and the manipulation becomes invisible.
--
-- The gap between "what I knew then" and "what was actually true" is not a
-- discrepancy to reconcile. It is the finding.
--
-- SIX CLOCKS (owner, 2026-08-01 14:28 — discovery_produced_at was REMOVED)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A seventh, discovery_produced_at, was proposed and killed the same session:
-- this corpus came from hand-me-down household devices, not legal process.
-- Do not re-add it.
--
--   Event     occurred_at         when it was sent
--   Artifact  export_created_at   when the backup was taken (COMPLETENESS BOUND:
--                                 a March backup cannot hold April messages, so
--                                 two exports with a window between them mean
--                                 missing coverage)
--             acquired_at         when the file entered possession
--             ingested_at         when the platform loaded it
--   Knowledge realized_at         when its significance was understood
--             transaction_time    when the row was written
--
-- Provenance is a SEPARATE block, not a clock (owner 14:27: "that's going to be
-- a legal argument issue, add provenance or how it was acquired as a followup
-- field"). It is HITL-only, never model-inferred, and append-only: if the
-- account of acquisition changes that is a new row, never an edit. `unclear`
-- is a first-class value — if every option is a justification, weak provenance
-- gets laundered into strong-sounding labels.
