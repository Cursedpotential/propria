-- SUPERSEDED (2026-08-09) — the "wrong engine" HOLD below is VOID.

-- ============================================================================
-- Originally parked 2026-08-02 (was sql/0009_walk_ledger.sql; own commit
-- 3f372dd flagged it "0009 wrong engine") on the theory that the walk
-- ledger belonged in SurrealDB alongside the rest of the analysis graph.
-- That theory no longer holds: ADR-0043 (2026-08-02, same day) retired
-- SurrealDB from the critical path — "SurrealDB exits the critical path...
-- freeze Surreal-specific feature work... only the owner deletes" — so the
-- SurrealKit/.surql redesign this file called for is not happening.
--
-- ADR-0045 Decision B (checkpoint-derivation architecture, 2026-08-09)
-- supersedes this file's placement question directly: the as-lived pass is
-- built by ONE grant-locked refresher appending the newly-visible slice at
-- each walk step, chain-hashing each step against the previous (prev_hash).
-- "These step records ARE the walk-ledger (working.walk_ledger) — this
-- closes OQ-1 and supersedes the SurrealDB rationale on
-- sql/drafts/walk_ledger.postgres-draft.HOLD.sql" (ADR-0045 §B). Postgres
-- `working.*` is therefore the correct engine after all — the walk-ledger
-- is the as-lived derivation log, chain-hashed and append-only, to be built
-- in segment S6 (HANDOFF-2026-08-09-S6-horizon-spine-derivation-engine).
--
-- The body below is KEPT VERBATIM as design input for S6, not promoted
-- as-is: S6 must reconcile it against ADR-0045's refresher/derivation
-- contract (sole-writer refresher, base-version pinning, chain-hash per
-- step) rather than lifting this file's schema unmodified. Do not delete;
-- do not apply.

-- 0009_walk_ledger.sql — the walk ledger: how each agent experienced the record.
--
-- Byline: Claude Code · Opus 5 · 2026-08-01
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ===============
-- Owner design, 2026-08-01: "creates a new table with foreign keys and the record
-- of its walk — so rather than appending the actual table we're just creating a
-- walk table as it does it."
--
-- PROJECT_CANON.md §1 (the killer mechanism): the platform reconstructs how a
-- person realizes they were abused, by running the same evidence past agents with
-- different KNOWLEDGE HORIZONS and diffing them.
--
--   ignorant agent   starts knowing nothing, walks forward living events as they
--                    were actually discovered; its horizon ADVANCES each step
--   hindsight agent  sees everything at once, including facts acquired years later
--
-- The DELTA between what those two agents experience IS the deceit, the
-- manipulation and the gaslighting. That delta is the deliverable.
--
-- A "pass" is therefore a retrieval filter bound to an agent — not a table, lane,
-- or destination. Owner: "ultimately it's just a permissions thing, and which
-- agents have hindsight." So nothing here partitions the evidence. Evidence stays
-- in analysis.normalized_record, written once, carrying all six clocks. This
-- schema records only WHAT EACH AGENT WAS SHOWN AND WHAT IT CONCLUDED.
--
-- DESIGN NOTES
-- ------------
-- * Additive. Creates new tables in `analysis` and touches nothing existing.
-- * APPEND-ONLY. A walk is a historical event: it happened, under a stated
--   horizon, over a recorded set. Never UPDATE a step. Re-running produces a NEW
--   walk_run, which is exactly what makes two walks diffable instead of one walk
--   silently degrading into the next.
-- * THE RETRIEVED SET IS RECORDED, NOT JUST THE CONCLUSION. Without it you cannot
--   prove the ignorant agent did not see something, and an unprovable delta is an
--   anecdote rather than evidence. It is also the only way to detect contamination
--   after the fact.
-- * Contamination is SILENT — one leaked future fact merely makes the ignorant
--   agent smarter; nothing errors. Postgres cannot prevent it (the check spans
--   tables), so vw_walk_contamination turns it into a query instead. Run that view
--   after every ignorant walk; a non-empty result invalidates the walk.
-- * uuidv7() (native in PG18) is time-ordered, so one run's steps cluster on disk —
--   which is the access pattern (replay a run in order).
