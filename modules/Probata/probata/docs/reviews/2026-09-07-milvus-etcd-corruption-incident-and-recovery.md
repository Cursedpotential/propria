## CORRECTION 2026-09-17 — the root cause below was wrong

The "corruption" was a **startup race**, not damaged metadata, and a separate etcd **does** fix it
when Milvus waits for etcd to be healthy.

- **Log proof (boot 2026-09-17 04:35:28Z, embedded etcd):** etcd started 28.98; Milvus's first
  metadata read (`by-dev/meta/session/id`) went out at 28.998 while etcd had **no leader**; etcd
  elected itself at 29.375; the pending read failed `etcdserver: leader changed` at 29.376 and
  Milvus panicked (rc=134). With `election-timeout: 10000` the same read failed ~7–10 s after start.
  Reverting to default timeouts only made it fail faster.
- **Why it looked like corruption:** a fresh store self-elects at bootstrap, so every rebuild booted;
  every restart of a store with data hit the race. "Heartbeat/election tuning" and "box load 0.54"
  were both consistent with this and ruled nothing out.
- **Why the earlier separate etcd "failed identically":** not reconstructable from the record; the
  deployment that works starts Milvus only after `etcdctl endpoint health` passes
  (`depends_on: condition: service_healthy`).
- **Fix shipped (probata `f934a93`, `d048761`):** app renamed `data-vector` → `memsearch-milvus`;
  `memsearch-etcd` (etcd v3.5.25) reusing the existing etcd data dir, health-gated; graceful stop
  240 s/300 s; mmap; JSON shredding stats off (separate nightly local-storage path bug).
- **Verified live:** two consecutive restarts of the populated store booted with 0 restarts;
  collection `agent_session_memory_nemotron3` Loaded, 78,301 rows; `memsearch search` returns hits.
- The recovery plan and options below are retained for the record and are **no longer current**.

## RESOLUTION (owner decision: Zilliz Cloud, free tier)

Owner chose managed Zilliz Cloud (free tier, $0) over disciplined self-hosting. memsearch is
now off the fragile VPS Milvus entirely — no etcd, no disk-fsync failure mode.

- **Cluster:** Free-01 serverless, `aws-eu-central-1`, endpoint
  `https://in03-834f340cad0f74d.serverless.aws-eu-central-1.cloud.zilliz.com`.
- **Wiring:** `~/.memsearch/config.toml` `[milvus]` uri → the cloud endpoint, `token = "env:MEMSEARCH_MILVUS_TOKEN"`;
  the API key lives in `~/.secrets/memsearch.env` (gitignored), never the repo. Config backed up to `config.toml.bak-*`.
- **Reindex:** `memsearch index ~/.memsearch/memory` → 585 chunks into collection `agent_session_memory_nemotron3`.
- **Flush gotcha (as predicted):** fresh inserts showed `row_count 0` until an explicit `flush` + `load_collection`
  via pymilvus. After that, `stats` = 585 and `memsearch search` returns real hits. **Always flush+load after the
  first index on a new Milvus/Zilliz collection.**
- **Validated live:** `search "milvus etcd corruption"` and `search "infra rename probata network"` both return
  relevant memories.
- **Cost:** $0 — 585 vectors is far under the free-tier cap (2 collections, ~1M 768-dim units).
- **VPS Milvus:** `data-vector` left **stopped**; it was memsearch's only real consumer (the platform data-vector role
  was already parked, ADR-0040). The corrupt volume stays intact under `/data/probata/volumes/milvus-memsearch` for
  now — owner deletes when ready.
- The zilliz-cli has **no Windows binary**; wiring was done with pymilvus (already in memsearch), no CLI needed.
- The second string the owner pasted (`key-…`) is **not** the Zilliz token (401) — set aside, unused, not stored.

The original incident analysis below is retained for the record.

## What happened

The `agno` → `probata` infra rename wave (2026-09-07) redeployed `data-vector`,
which bounced the all-in-one Milvus standalone container. On restart it entered a
`etcdserver: leader changed` panic loop (exit 134), climbing restart count with the
box otherwise idle. This is the **7th** such corruption on this deployment.

The heartbeat/election tuning (`heartbeat-interval: 1000`, `election-timeout: 10000`)
was already applied **and** verified mounted inside the container, yet it still looped.
Box load was 0.54 during the loop. So this is **not** a resource/boot-race stall — the
embedded-etcd metadata in the volume is corrupt.

## Root cause (owner research + our evidence)

- **Ungraceful etcd termination corrupts the metadata store.** Upstream Milvus issue
  [milvus-io/milvus#40575](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/issues/40575) documents
  the same class: force-killing etcd → `CrashLoopBackOff`, members drop out, no clean
  fix in comments. Upstream guidance: **shut Milvus down first, then etcd**, so Milvus
  persists its final state before etcd stops.
- Our all-in-one `milvus run standalone` container runs etcd **in-process**. A Coolify
  redeploy SIGKILLs the whole container, so Milvus and its embedded etcd die together,
  ungracefully — exactly the sequence #40575 warns against.
- **Owner-confirmed: a separate etcd service failed identically.** So the cause is the
  ungraceful-kill + disk-fsync sensitivity, **not** embedded-vs-external etcd. Adding a
  separate etcd does not fix it.

## Why we can recover cheaply

memsearch's collection `agent_session_memory_nemotron3` is a **projection** of local
source, not primary data:

- Source: **8,098 Claude session transcripts, 3.2G, `~/.claude/projects`** (this desktop).
- Embedder: NIM `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b` (returns vectors; verified).
- The 1.6G segment data + 246M etcd dir sit intact in the volume, but Milvus cannot use
  segments without coherent etcd metadata, and there is **no backup** (only a 25M Aug-5
  tarball predating current data).

So a full reset + reindex is cheaper and more reliable than bbolt surgery on the corrupt
`member/snap/db` (the #40575 all-pods-crash recovery).

## Recovery plan (on owner go)

1. **Quarantine** `/data/probata/volumes/milvus-memsearch/etcd` (and `rdb_data*` WAL) to
   `/data/.review_hold/` — moved, never deleted; reversible.
2. **Decouple** Milvus + Attu from the shared `probata` docker network (memsearch reaches
   Milvus at the tailnet IP `100.91.190.107:19530`, not docker DNS), so no future
   platform-tier wave bounces it. Edit `deploy/data-vector.yaml`.
3. **Restart** Milvus → boots healthy with fresh embedded etcd, empty collection.
4. **Re-index** memsearch from the 8,098 local transcripts.
5. **Live-validate** a real search returns hits. The embedder-switch failure mode is a
   silent empty index, so this step is mandatory (see the 2026-09-03 memsearch rebuke).

## Durable options (memsearch needs Milvus — it is a zilliz/milvus MCP)

pgvector and Qdrant are ruled out: the MCP speaks Milvus. Etcd-free ways to keep Milvus:

| Option | What | Etcd? | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Zilliz Cloud** | managed Milvus, free tier | none (managed) | **best fit** — MCP already speaks a URI+token; no local disk-fsync exposure |
| ~~Milvus Lite~~ | embedded file-based Milvus | none | **RULED OUT for this box (owner 2026-09-07): Linux/WSL only, WSL is unreliable here; also not a network service** |
| Keep self-hosted | milvus-standalone on VPS | yes (embedded) | fallback — must add graceful-stop + never-bounce discipline |

If we keep self-hosted: raise `stop_grace_period`, ensure Coolify sends SIGTERM (not
SIGKILL) with enough grace for Milvus to flush etcd, and keep it off platform-tier
redeploy waves (step 2 above). Milvus Lite is not an option on the Windows desktop
(no reliable WSL) and would not serve networked recall anyway, so the durable choice is
**Zilliz Cloud vs. disciplined self-hosting**.
