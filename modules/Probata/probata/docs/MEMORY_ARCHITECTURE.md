# Memory / Recall / Context Architecture

The single map of every memory/recall/context system: what it's for, where it lives, **who writes to
it, when, and how compliance is actually checked**. If you're about to add a new memory mechanism —
**don't**; fit it into one of these or extend this doc.

> **Why this was rewritten.** On 2026-08-05 an audit found the previous version listed 6 lanes while
> 9 existed — Graphiti (mandated in `CLAUDE.md`), `CHANGE-ORDER.md` (self-described "ledger of
> record") and Spec Memory had all been added *without* extending this doc, in direct violation of

> the change-order went unwritten 16 days; 27 memories sat unreachable across 6 stores; the Graphiti
> lane went unused for an entire session; memsearch's embed→Milvus indexing had been dead; and this
> doc itself was stale and wrong. The lesson is in **Rule 2**.

## Rule 0 — canonical working directory (and its real limits)

**Always open Claude Code at the workspace ROOT** (`E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/the-platform-workspace`).

The **cwd-keyed** lanes — CNF (`.claude/memories/`), `.remember/`, `.memsearch/` — key off the open
folder, so one working dir keeps them from fragmenting. That part works.

⚠️ **Rule 0 does NOT protect auto-memory.** ~~Opening at the root prevents fragmentation.~~
**Corrected 2026-08-05:** auto-memory keys off the **project**, not the open folder, so Rule 0 has no
effect on it. Reality check that day found **10 separate auto-memory stores**, including a 121-file
and a 134-file store created by sessions opened in subdirectories, plus one with no index at all.
Consolidating them is an open task. Until then, `memory_health.py` reports every store it finds.

## Rule 1 — never delete
NEVER `rm`/delete. Move stale/duplicate files into the root `_stale/`; the owner removes them later.
Mechanically enforced by the `cc_guard` hook (it blocks `rm -rf` outright — verified live 2026-08-05).

## Rule 2 — hooks are good at "don't", bad at "do"
Every mechanism that worked before 2026-08-05 either **blocked a destructive action** or **reacted to
a file write**. Nothing verified a *positive obligation* — that a fact got written, a ladder got
searched, a ledger got appended, a lane got used. That asymmetry is why all five failures above were
silent rather than noisy.

**So: any lane carrying a standing obligation needs an explicit check, or it will rot unobserved.**
The Enforcement column below is the honest status of each. `honour-system` means *nothing will tell
you when it lapses* — treat those as the risk list, not as "fine".

## The lanes (one home per concern)

| # | Concern | Canonical home | Writer / tool | Write WHEN | Enforcement | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Auto-memory** — durable cross-session facts (owner prefs, decisions, infra) | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` — `MEMORY.md` index + one frontmatter `.md` per fact | Claude Code native | A durable fact is established or corrected | **ENFORCED** — `memory_index_guard.py` (Stop + SessionStart) catches files missing from the index, missing indexes, and broken links | ⚠️ **fragmented across 10 stores**; 27 orphans found 2026-08-05 (active store fixed, rest open) |
| 2 | **Graphiti** — entity/relationship + temporal graph; the ignorant agent's accumulating belief state | Neo4j (`memory` DB) via the `grc` CLI | `~/.claude/skills/graphiti-client/scripts/grc.py` (**primary**; MCP only when a server happens to be registered) | Recall before a non-trivial task; record durable facts as established | **CHECKABLE** — `grc doctor` already tests transport, tools, search roundtrip AND episode freshness. It was simply never run; `memory_health.py` now runs it | ⚠️ **read-healthy, write-dead** — all connectivity PASS, but newest episode **135h old** (2026-08-05). Nobody has been recording |
| 3 | **SSOT docs** — vision, decisions, ADRs, plans, conventions | `Agno-MCP-Platform/docs/` | Hand-maintained per PROJECT_CANON §0 | A decision is made or reality changes | **PARTIAL** — `adr-index.py` PostToolUse auto-indexes new ADRs (verified). Nothing checks DECISION_LOG or doc drift | ✅ ADR ledger continuous 0001–0044 |
| 4 | **CHANGE-ORDER** — append-as-you-go ledger of executed changes | `C:\Users\matts\OneDrive\AI Space\CHANGE-ORDER.md` | Whoever makes the change, **same turn** | After ANY executed change: what / where / why-authorization / reversal | `honour-system` | ⚠️ lapsed 07-20 → 08-04 (16 days), resumed 2026-08-05 |
| 5 | **CNF session-recall** — realtime capture + manual entries | `.claude/memories/project_memory.json` (ROOT) | claude-never-forgets fork (`/cnf-*`) | Automatic; `/cnf-remember` for manual | auto-consolidates at 20 entries | ✅ |
| 6 | **Session handoff** — day snapshots, now/recent/archive | `.remember/` (ROOT) | recall plugin (PreCompact, SessionStart) | Automatic | hook-driven | ✅ |
| 7 | **memsearch** — semantic search over past sessions | `.memsearch/` per git root | memsearch CLI + plugin hooks | Automatic | `honour-system` on health | 🔴 **BROKEN** — see Known-broken |
| 8 | **Spec Memory** — recent-context blocks injected into `CLAUDE.md` files | the `CLAUDE.md` files themselves | external tooling | Automatic | none | ℹ️ low-value; episodic noise |
| 9 | **Archive** — stale/duplicates | `_stale/` (ROOT) | Rule 1 moves | On supersession | `cc_guard` blocks deletes | ✅ |

### Repository-local progressive memory is part of SSOT docs, not lane 10

`AGENT_MEMORY.md` and `.agent-memory/<exact-filename>.md` are a progressively disclosed
index into lane 3. They hold sourced local learnings, preferences, failure modes, and links to
authority. They do not replace or duplicate canon, ADRs, the decision log, current handoffs,
runtime memory, or session recall.

Load them root-to-leaf after the matching `AGENTS.md` files. Exact-file memory loads only when
that file is in scope. Current canon and verification receipts always outrank repository-local
memory. The format, required status metadata, and promotion rules live in
`docs/agent-memory/README.md`.

Also present, not a lane: `.claude/recall-context.md` — populated by the recall plugin and
`@`-included by the root `CLAUDE.md`.

### Which lane wins on conflict
**SSOT docs (#3) > auto-memory (#1) > Graphiti (#2) > CNF (#5) / handoff (#6) / memsearch (#7).**
Newer owner statements beat all of them. A memory is a point-in-time observation; the SSOT is intent.

## The contract — standing obligations

Four things are owed every session. Nothing else in this doc matters if these lapse.

1. **Recall before planning.** Non-trivial task ⇒ search the ladder below *before* proposing an
   approach. Cite what you found; never assert from memory-of-memory.
2. **Record durable facts when established** — owner corrections, decisions + rationale, infra
   changes, "X is now Y". Auto-memory for the fact; Graphiti for the entities/timeline. Writing the
   file is only half — **the `MEMORY.md` index line is what makes it exist** (lane #1 is guarded
   precisely because that half kept getting skipped).
3. **Append the change order the same turn** as any executed change (#4).
4. **Comply with a rule the moment you find it** — a standing rule IS the authorization; don't ask
   permission to follow it. (Still confirm when the *action* is destructive or outward-facing.)

## Search-priority ladder
1. Auto-memory `MEMORY.md` index → the frontmatter `.md` (durable, project-keyed).
2. Graphiti — `grc search facts "<terms>"` / `grc search nodes` (entity/temporal).
3. CNF `project_memory.json` (current-session realtime).
4. `.remember/` handoff (recent/day) → memsearch (older turns, stale-aware).
5. **ASK the owner** if 1–4 yield nothing — never fabricate prior work.

## Memory protocol discipline
_(borrowed from the retired `mem0-protocol` skill, 2026-07-05 — discipline, not a new lane)_

**Anti-hallucination** — search-then-cite, never memory-of-memory; verify a write succeeded before
treating a fact as stored; surface discrepancies ("memory says X, I see Y") rather than silently
picking; only verbatim or confirmed facts.

**Correction protocol** — save the NEW fact immediately by updating the existing `.md` (don't
duplicate); record the transition in the body (`Previous: X. Updated to: Y. Reason: <owner wording>`);
apply it for the rest of the session; stop citing the superseded value.

**Save / don't-save** — SAVE owner corrections, preferences, decisions-with-rationale, infra changes,
bug+exact-error+fix. DON'T save greetings, generic advice, transient paths, hypotheticals, or
chit-chat CNF already captures.

## Health check
```
python ~/.claude/hooks/memory_health.py          # all lanes, PASS/WARN/FAIL
python ~/.claude/hooks/memory_index_guard.py --check   # auto-memory index only
```
Run it when resuming, or any time a lane feels stale. It is read-only.

## Known-broken (as of 2026-08-05)
- 🔴 **memsearch indexing dead — TWO stacked faults.**
  1. ~~`embedding.provider = "onnx"` with `model = "gemini-embedding-001"`~~ **FIXED 2026-08-05**:
     provider set to **`google`** (not `gemini` — that string isn't in memsearch's `_PROVIDERS`
     registry and raises `Unknown embedding provider`). Verified standalone: init 1.8s, embed 0.3s,
     **dim 768**, which matches every existing collection, so no re-embed was needed.
  2. 🔴 **STILL BROKEN — Milvus.** With the embedder fixed, indexing now hangs instead of erroring.
     Thread-stack dump: `store.py:_load_collection` → `pymilvus.load_collection` →
     `wait_for_loading_collection` → `time.sleep` forever. `get_load_state` shows **3 of 6
     collections stuck at `Loading, progress: 0`** (`agent_session_memory`,
     `ms_agno_mcp_platform_9e350219` (dropped 2026-09-06; successor `ms_probata_4ac6a58f` after the directory rename), `ms_double_shot_latte_4080276b`); the other 3 load fine.
     Milvus accepts the connection and lists collections instantly — it just never finishes loading
     these three. **This is the live argument for ADR-0040's Weaviate cutover**, which already
     locked Weaviate and sidelined Milvus; memsearch still pointing at Milvus is drift from canon
     *and* is now the thing blocking semantic recall.
  The Claude Code memsearch plugin is also 11 versions behind (0.4.6 vs 0.4.17).
- ⚠️ **Auto-memory fragmented across 10 stores** (Rule 0). 27 orphans outside the active store,
  including a store with no `MEMORY.md` at all. Several are `*.from-*.md` sync artifacts — decide
  what those are before indexing them.
- ⚠️ **Graphiti write-lane silently stalled.** `grc doctor` 2026-08-05: every connectivity check
  PASSes (direct init, ContextForge init, status, 9 tools, search roundtrip with a working embedder)
  but **episode freshness FAILs — newest episode 135h old**. The lane isn't broken; the *obligation*
  lapsed and nothing noticed. Textbook Rule 2.
- ℹ️ **Two working Graphiti transports** (corrected 2026-08-05): the direct no-auth door
  `100.119.96.29:8071` **and** the authenticated ContextForge route
  `100.72.169.40:4444/servers/<id>/mcp`. `grc` prefers direct. Retiring the no-auth door is an open
  ADR-0037 item — when it happens, `grc` should fall back to the CF route rather than break.
