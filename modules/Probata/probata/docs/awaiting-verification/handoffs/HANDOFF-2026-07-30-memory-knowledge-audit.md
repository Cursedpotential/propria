## AUDIT RESULT — AgentOS memory/knowledge "broken on first open"

Read-only audit completed 2026-07-30 (agno==2.6.13 in local venv; prod requirements pins 2.8.0). Findings ranked:

### #1 — DB id collision (root cause — CONFIRMED LIVE, FIXED, DEPLOYED)
- `server/core/session.py:40` `DB_ID = "agentos-db"` used by BOTH `get_agno_db()` (SurrealDb, line ~179) and `get_postgres_db()` (line ~165).
- `main.py:179` agents get SurrealDb; `main.py:199` `admin_db = get_postgres_db()` → `AgentOS(db=admin_db)` (main.py:237).
- agno `os/app.py:1325-1334` registers dbs keyed by `db.id` → both backends merge into ONE bucket `"agentos-db"`.
- agno `os/utils.py:246-312` resolver: multi-db guard counts dict KEYS (=1) so it never fires → memory/session/knowledge-content routes hit SurrealDb-or-Postgres by registration order + table-name luck.
- Timeline: admin-db split 2026-07-23 (main.py:21 byline) → owner saw breakage 2026-07-27. Weaviate cutover was a red herring.
- **Fix**: distinct ids — e.g. `get_postgres_db()` admin call → `id="agentos-admin-db"`; contents_db its own id. Then verify registry shows 2 keys and memory routes resolve to SurrealDb explicitly.
- ~~**PENDING OWNER DECISION** (was Option A/B/C): confirm live first (below), then apply.~~
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-31** (`9a7e4ac`, option (a)): SurrealDb keeps `agentos-db`, admin plane →
  `agentos-admin-db`, Knowledge contents → `agentos-contents-db`. Live `/config` had returned
  `databases:["agentos-db"]` (1 key) before the fix — root cause confirmed, not just inferred.
- Same commit set `enable_user_memories` on Root Router + Project PAL: the live check found
  `agno_memories` with **0 rows in BOTH backends**, so the memory panel was empty for a second,
  independent reason — nothing was ever extracting memories.
- ~~**NOT IN PROD YET**~~ — **IN PROD 2026-08-01**, verified: `/memories` 200, `/sessions` 200.

#### Pre-deploy gate (NEW — **PROVEN** 2026-08-01 by executable probe, not inference)

**Probe:** `scratchpad/db_id_gate_probe.py` builds a real `AgentOS` on agno **2.8.0** with throwaway
SQLite dbs in both registry shapes and calls `GET /memories` through a `TestClient`:

| Registry shape | `/config` databases | `GET /memories` (no `db_id`) | `GET /memories?db_id=…` |
|---|---|---|---|
| BEFORE fix — one shared id | `['agentos-db']` | **200** (silently wrong backend) | 200 |
| AFTER fix — three ids | `['agentos-db','agentos-contents-db','agentos-admin-db']` | **400** `db_id query parameter is required` | 200 |

**Live state confirmed the same day** (tailnet `http://100.72.169.40:8000/config`, HTTP 200):
`databases: ['agentos-db']`, `os_id: mcp-forensic-platform`; container
`agentos-api-rz41wqhpjfh1rj796ixvjhfs-…` started **2026-07-23T06:35Z** — i.e. the pre-fix image,
still the one-key shape. The audit's root cause is now proven at both ends.

> Note: `https://agentos.mitechconsult.com` returns 503 (`no available server`). That is
> **pre-existing and already documented** in `docs/adr/0035-*.md:168` — Traefik has no dynamic route
> for the host and the `default_redirect_503.yaml` catch-all answers. It is NOT a regression and not
> the owner's path: the control surface tunnels to tailnet `:8000`, which serves 200.

**Agno's documented contract** (docs.agno.com, `agent-os/knowledge/manage-knowledge`): omitting the
id is explicitly *backward-compatibility for the single-instance case*; multi-instance callers are
expected to pass `db_id`/`knowledge_id`. So the 400 is agno working as designed, not a bug.

~~**The gate that remains:** whether the os.agno.com SPA actually sends `db_id`.~~
**GATE CLEARED 2026-08-01 (`6bfb522`) — the UI question no longer blocks the deploy.**
`server/api/db_id_middleware.py` defaults an absent `db_id` to the SurrealDb operational store on
every route that accepts one, so routing is **deliberate** rather than a lottery (pre-fix) or a 400
(post-fix). Requests carrying their own `db_id`/`knowledge_id` are untouched. Target routes are
found by **inspecting endpoint signatures**, not a path allowlist, because agno moves routes between
minor versions; the installer returns a count and `main.py` `log_warning`s on 0 so an upstream
rename is loud. Proven end to end on agno 2.8.0:

| Shape | `GET /memories` (no `db_id`) |
|---|---|
| one shared id | 200 — wrong backend |
| three ids | **400** |
| three ids + middleware | **200** (48 routes covered) |

Suite after the change: **414 passed / 3 skipped / 0 failed**; ruff clean; mypy unchanged.

#### Superseded reasoning (kept for history)

The audit reasoned against agno 2.6.13 (local venv). Re-verified in 2.8.0 — the mechanism holds,
and it has a **behavioural edge the fix introduces**:

- `AgentOS._register_db_with_validation` builds `dbs: Dict[str, List[db]]`, appending same-id
  backends into ONE list under one key. Confirmed.
- `agno/os/utils.py` resolver: `if len(dbs) > 1: raise HTTPException(400, "The db_id query
  parameter is required when using multiple databases")`. It counts **keys**. With one shared id
  the guard never fired and the resolver returned `all_dbs[0]` — the first-registered backend,
  regardless of which one owns the table. Exactly the audit's claim.
- **Edge:** post-fix the registry has **3 keys**, so that guard now DOES fire. `db_id` is
  `Optional[str] = Query(default=None)` on *every* memory route — so any client that omits it gets
  a hard **400** where it previously got a silently-wrong-but-200 answer.
- **Therefore, before/at redeploy:** confirm the AgentOS UI sends `db_id` on memory/session/
  knowledge calls. If it does not, the fix converts a silent-wrong bug into a visible-broken one.
  Mitigation if needed: keep the admin/contents split but re-merge the two Postgres roles under a
  single id, leaving 2 keys, and pass `db_id` explicitly from our own callers.

## RESOLVED + DEPLOYED 2026-08-01 — eight bugs, each masking the next

The branch is merged to `main` and **live in prod**. Verified against the running
instance, not inferred:

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /memories` (no `db_id`) | 400 | **200** |
| `GET /sessions` | 400 | **200**, 8 sessions |
| agents / teams | served | **6 / 3** |
| embedder | 400 "model does not exist" | **200, 4096-d vector** |
| Weaviate objects | 7 (1 doc) | **59 (5 docs)** |
| content rows | 2 false-COMPLETED, 2 FAILED | **7 completed / 1 failed** |
| `ingest_all` | 500, wrote nothing | **`INGEST OK, files: 4`** |

**The chain — fixing each one revealed the next:**

1. **DB-id collision** (`9a7e4ac`) — one registry key, routes resolved by
   registration-order lottery.
2. **Missing transitive deps** (`e999dd2`) — `requirements.txt` pinned
   `weaviate-client` but not `validators`/`authlib`/`joserfc`. `session.py`
   imports Weaviate at module scope, so prod **crash-looped** (11 restarts).
   agno masks the real `ModuleNotFoundError: validators` as "Weaviate is not
   installed", which sent the first diagnosis the wrong way.
3. **Middleware matched ZERO routes** (`a930114`) — the `db_id` guard scanned
   `app.routes` for `APIRoute`, but under `base_app=` agno's routes are
   `_IncludedRouter` objects one level down. The test built a bare
   `AgentOS(agents=...)` and passed while prod 400'd.
4. **`fetch_objects(where=)`** (`3e3813d`) — agno 2.8.0 uses the v3 kwarg;
   weaviate-client 4.22.0 wants `filters=`. Fatal, not cosmetic: it runs AFTER
   the write, so it aborted the whole reindex on file 1.
5. **Async client → `localhost:8080`** (`5483d76`) — **the root cause of
   "knowledge never populates"**. `Weaviate.__init__` has no `async_client`
   param and `get_async_client()` falls back to `use_async_with_local()`. The
   ingest path is fully async while search is sync, so every probe passed and
   only WRITES failed, silently.
6. **`meta_data` dict vs text** (`9bc142f`) — 422 "not a string, but
   map[string]interface {}".
7. **`filters` is `object`, not `text`** (`a3d897f`) — fix #6 serialized BOTH
   properties and broke `filters`. Read the live schema instead of assuming:
   `meta_data text`, `filters object`. Encoding is now a per-property table.
8. **Search results missing `id`** (`3ec7d90`) — `POST /knowledge/search` 500'd
   on EVERY call: agno's `Weaviate.get_search_results()` (the shared helper
   behind vector/keyword/hybrid, sync + async, 6 call sites) builds each result
   `Document` without setting `id`, but `VectorSearchResult.from_document()`
   requires `id: str`. This is the API Studio/Chat retrieval uses to display
   ingested text — so there was no way to view chunk content through AgentOS at
   all. It could only surface AFTER #5/#6/#7, because search is unreachable
   against an empty index. Fixed by backfilling `id` from the Weaviate UUID.

**FINAL VERIFIED STATE (live, 2026-08-01):**

| Endpoint | Result |
|---|---|
| `/config` | 200 — 6 agents, 3 teams |
| `/memories` (no `db_id`) | 200 |
| `/sessions` | 200 — 8 sessions |
| `/memory_topics` | 200 |
| `/knowledge/search` | **200 — 10 results with real chunk text** |
| Weaviate | 59 objects / 5 documents |
| content rows | 7 completed / 1 failed (legacy `PROJECT_CANON.md`) |

Correction to an earlier claim in this doc: "Studio empty" was reported as
purely a UI-surface confusion. That was right for agents/teams but INCOMPLETE —
Studio's *retrieval* was genuinely broken by #8. Two separate causes.

**Standing lessons (all earned the hard way today):**
- A library's error message can be a lie — agno reported "Weaviate is not
  installed" for a missing *transitive* dep, and "Could not upsert embedding"
  for a wrong *host*. Read the underlying traceback, never the wrapper's text.
- Test the REAL topology. A guard verified against a simplified app is not
  verified. #3 shipped green tests straight into a silent prod failure.
- Sync-working ≠ async-working. #5 hid for weeks because every manual probe used
  the sync path.
- The honest-failure guard is what made #5 findable — it turned "COMPLETED with
  zero vectors" into a loud FAILED. Build the tripwire first.

**Still open (NOT fixed):**
- **GitHub→Coolify webhook is dead.** Merges to `main` do not auto-deploy
  despite `watch_paths` covering `server/**`; every deploy today was a manual
  Coolify API call. Very likely why prod sat on the 2026-07-23 image for 9 days.
- **`agentos:latest` is overwritten in place** — no rollback target existed
  during the crash-loop. Deploy by digest, as the Graphiti image already does.
- `PROJECT_CANON.md` remains the 1 failed content row (legacy; its file is no
  longer under the ingest path).
- OpenRouter key is out of credits (402). NOT rotated — owner's call.

### "NOTHING IN THE PLATFORM IS POPULATED" — answered against the live API (2026-08-01)

Owner report, with 13 UI screenshots: *"really nothing in the platform is populated or functional,
no agents, no workflows, knowledge, entities, nothing."* Checked `GET /config` on the live instance
(tailnet `:8000`, HTTP 200). The roster **is** served:

| Surface | Live API says | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Agents** | **6** — ingestion-orchestrator, analysis-orchestrator, review-gatekeeper, dev-copilot, project-pal, forensic-data-agent | ✅ populated |
| **Teams** | **3** — mcp-platform-router, platform-ops, builder | ✅ populated |
| **Workflows** | **0** | ❌ genuinely none registered |
| **Interfaces** | **0** | (none configured) |
| **Knowledge** | 1 instance `platform` → `agentos-db` / `platform_knowledge_contents` | ⚠ contents exist, vectors mostly missing (above) |
| **Databases** | **1** — `agentos-db` | ❌ the collision, still live |

**The agents/teams complaint is a UI-surface confusion, not an outage.** The screenshots are of
**Studio → Agents / Teams / Workflows** (`os.agno.com/studio/*`), which is agno's **cloud authoring**
surface — "Get started by creating a new agent", with greyed *demo templates* (Support Agent, Data
Agent, Sales Team, Report Generator…). Those are agno's samples, not ours. Agents defined in Python
and served by a connected AgentOS do **not** appear there; they appear under **Chat** (the
agent/team picker) and in **Studio → Registry**.

**Registry corroborates the connection is healthy** — it shows our real instance: model `Ollama /
GLM-5.1`, tools `apply_db_modification` / `describe_tool` / `execute_tool`, database `AGENTOS-DB`.

**Genuinely broken/empty, with causes:**
1. **Memory panel empty** — `agno_memories` 0 rows in both backends; nothing ever extracted
   memories. Fixed in `9a7e4ac` (`enable_user_memories`), **not yet deployed**.
2. **Knowledge mostly unretrievable** — 3 of 4 content rows have no vectors (table above).
3. **Workflows genuinely 0** — `server/evidence/workflows.py` exists but nothing is registered as
   an AgentOS `Workflow`, so the panel is correctly empty. Separate piece of work.
4. **Entity Memories empty** — same root cause as (1).

**Useful UI evidence for the deploy gate:** the Memory page renders an explicit
`Database: agentos-db / Table: agno_memories` selector — i.e. the SPA *is* database-aware and
resolves a specific db, which is encouraging (though not proof) for it sending `db_id` once the
registry holds three keys.

### DEPLOY BLOCKERS — what a redeploy of this branch actually ships (verified 2026-08-01)

The redeploy is **not** just the db-id fix. The live image is the **2026-07-23** build; the branch
has moved on twice since. Verified by probing the running container directly:

```
docker exec <agentos-api> python -c "import weaviate"  -> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'weaviate'
docker exec <agentos-api> python -c "import agno"      -> 2.8.0
docker exec <agentos-api> python -c "import pymilvus"  -> 3.0.0
```

So prod today is **still Milvus-era code**. One redeploy lands three changes at once:

| # | Change | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | db-id split (`9a7e4ac`) | **Arms agno's multi-db guard** — clients omitting `db_id` get 400 (proven by probe) |
| 2 | **Milvus → Weaviate cutover goes live for the first time** | See count mismatch below |
| 3 | `enable_user_memories` on Root Router + Project PAL | Benign/desired — memory capture starts working |

**Count mismatch — RAISED then RESOLVED the same day. NOT a blocker.**

> ~~Milvus 14 rows vs Weaviate 7 objects → "cutting over risks halving the knowledge base".~~
> **Wrong — corrected 2026-08-01 by a full `query_iterator` walk.** Milvus's `row_count: 14` is a
> segment-level statistic that counts soft-deleted/uncompacted rows (the doc was re-indexed once).
> Iterating the collection returns **7 live rows**. Both stores hold the *same* content:

| Store | Live rows | Distinct sha256 | Chunks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Milvus `platform_knowledge` | **7** | `d8f1b80f8826` ×7 | 1–7 |
| Weaviate `Platform_knowledge` | **7** | `d8f1b80f8826` ×7 | 1–7 |

**Vector parity is exact.** The Milvus→Weaviate export is complete. Lesson: never compare
`get_collection_stats()['row_count']` against another store's object count — walk the collection.

**The REAL knowledge defect (found via the owner's 2026-08-01 UI screenshots):** the Knowledge page
lists **4 content rows**, but only **one** of them has vectors in either store:

| Content row | Status in UI | Vectors |
|---|---|---|
| `d8f1b80f8826-d11a456b…` (file, 23 Jul) | COMPLETED | **7 chunks** ✅ |
| `38dfbfc8bbce-63ec8468…` (file, 20 Jul) | COMPLETED | **none** ❌ |
| `PROJECT_CANON.md` (file, 20 Jul) | **FAILED** | none |
| `ingest-smoke-test` (text) | COMPLETED | **none** ❌ |

So contents rows (Postgres) and vectors (Milvus/Weaviate) have diverged: two rows report COMPLETED
with nothing embedded, one hard-FAILED. That — not the cutover — is why knowledge retrieval looks
empty. Chase the ingest/embed path, and note the global rule: a `float vector field … got nil`
class of failure means the embedder returned no vector (dead key / out-of-credits / gateway).

**Finding #3 (Weaviate client-close race) is NOT observable in prod** and cannot be: 9 days of
`agentos-api` logs contain **zero** `WeaviateClosedClientError`, zero gRPC `UNAVAILABLE`, and zero
mentions of Weaviate at all — because the module isn't installed. The race becomes live only
*after* this redeploy. It is a post-deploy watch item, not a pre-deploy one.

### #2 — uv.lock stale/trap
- `uv.lock` (2026-07-23) has NO weaviate-client → local `.venv` cannot import `server.core.session` at all (top-level Weaviate import). Verified live.
- Prod likely safe: Dockerfile + CI install from requirements.txt (`weaviate-client==4.22.0`, `agno==2.8.0`).
- ~~**Fix**: `uv lock` regen + rebuild `.venv`.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-31** — the lock already carried
  `weaviate-client==4.22.0`; `uv sync --extra dev` rebuilt the venv. `server.core.session` imports
  clean (re-verified 2026-08-01).
- ~~**Residual, still open:** `uv.lock` pins `agno==2.6.13` … **Fix**: pin `agno==2.8.0` in
  `pyproject.toml`~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-01, by a different mechanism than first proposed.**
  - Correction: `uv.lock` is **gitignored**; `.gitignore:31` states *"requirements.txt is the
    lockfile of record"*. `requirements.txt` is generated by `uv pip compile pyproject.toml`
    (`scripts/generate_requirements.sh`) and the image installs it via
    `uv pip sync requirements.txt --system`. So pinning pyproject was the wrong lever.
  - `uv pip sync requirements.txt` **cannot run on Windows** — the file is a Linux-target compile
    (contains `uvloop==0.22.1`; see commit `c0fe6cb` "regenerate requirements.txt for linux, not the
    compiling host"). This is why local dev uses `uv sync` from pyproject instead. Not a defect.
  - Applied instead: `uv lock --upgrade-package agno` (resolved 2.8.6, latest) then pinned the venv
    to prod's exact version with `uv pip install "agno[os,slack]==2.8.0"`. Run tests with
    `uv run --no-sync` so `uv run` does not re-sync 2.8.6 over it.
  - **Result: 406 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed.** The previously-recorded "1 pre-existing agno
    tool-roster failure" was an **artefact of the 2.6.13 skew** — it passes on prod's 2.8.0. There
    is no known-failing test on this branch.
  - Still-open (cosmetic, pre-existing, untouched): `ruff format --check` would reformat 7 test
    files; `mypy server` reports 2 errors in `server/evidence/cli.py:55`.

### #3 — agno Weaviate wrapper closes shared client per sync search
- agno `vectordb/weaviate/weaviate.py:487/565/646` `finally: get_client().close()` on the ONE shared client. Self-healing sequentially; race under concurrent UI panel loads. insert/upsert don't close (asymmetry).
- **Check**: agentos-api logs for `WeaviateClosedClientError` / gRPC UNAVAILABLE at UI-open times. Fix = upstream/pin, not platform code.

### #4 — Doc drift ("Milvus-backed" in providers.py:61, factory.py:144, knowledge_handle.py docstring, main.py:149/166, settings.py:15) — mechanical cleanup.
- **RESOLVED 2026-07-31** (`9a7e4ac`) across main.py, factory.py, providers.py, knowledge_handle.py,
  settings.py, store.py, core/README.md, evidence/AGENTS.md, server/AGENTS.md. Deliberate
  deprecation aliases left untouched.

### #5 — ADR-0038 accepted 2026-07-29 but UNIMPLEMENTED — `graphiti-core` nowhere in deps/code; Graphiti still MCP-only (`providers.py:180-195`, silently skipped if `GRAPHITI_MCP_URL` unset — also presents as "memory features missing").
- **Still open, now sequenced behind the image rebuild.** Research completed 2026-07-31:
  `docs/planning/graphiti-image-rebuild-plan.md`. We run `zepai/knowledge-graph-mcp:latest`, digest
  built 2026-03-11, **unpinned**; upstream `DatabaseDriverFactory.create_config` drops the `database`
  field on the neo4j branch (a ~6-line wiring gap, fixable upstream), which is why the hotfix pile
  exists. Three owner questions are open at the foot of that doc.

### ~~Live checks still needed (Option C)~~ — ALL RAN 2026-07-31
1. ~~Running container: does AgentOS db registry show 1 key or 2?~~ **1 key** (`databases:["agentos-db"]`) — confirms #1.
2. ~~Browser/network trace of the exact failing UI call.~~ Ran; combined with (1) and the empty `agno_memories` finding.
3. ~~Was the deployed image built BEFORE weaviate-client landed in requirements.txt?~~ Ran — live image is the 2026-07-23 build.
4. ~~Does Weaviate `Platform_knowledge` actually hold objects post-cutover?~~ Ran.
5. ~~`GRAPHITI_MCP_URL` set on live agentos-api?~~ Ran.

## UNRESOLVED (mandatory)

_Updated 2026-08-01. Resolved entries kept struck-through for history._

- ~~**Root-cause fix #1 NOT applied**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-07-31 (`9a7e4ac`).
- ~~**All five live checks below are unrun**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-07-31, all five ran.
- ~~**BUILD_STATUS UNKNOWN**~~ — RESOLVED: ruff clean, 405 tests pass with one pre-existing agno
  tool-roster failure that also fails on stash.
- ~~**Findings #2–#5 all open**~~ — #2 and #4 resolved; #3 and #5 still open, plus two new items:
- **#1 fix is committed but NOT DEPLOYED** — WHY: live agentos-api still runs the 2026-07-23 image;
  the fix reaches prod only via merge + exec-tier redeploy. SHORTCOMING of leaving it: the owner's
  original "broken on first open" symptom is still live in prod today.
- ~~**Pre-deploy gate on the #1 fix**~~ — **CLEARED 2026-08-01 (`6bfb522`)**, mitigation applied and
  proven end to end. See "Pre-deploy gate" under finding #1.
- **Deploy itself still not done** — the branch is ready (414 tests green at prod's agno 2.8.0), but
  merge + exec-tier redeploy has not run, so prod remains the 2026-07-23 image.
- **Post-deploy watch items:** (a) Weaviate client-close race (finding #3) becomes live for the
  first time — grep `agentos-api` logs for `WeaviateClosedClientError` / gRPC `UNAVAILABLE` at
  UI-open times; (b) confirm `/config` reports three databases and the Memory panel populates.
- ~~**agno version skew**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-01, see finding #2.
- **Public `agentos.mitechconsult.com` 503** — pre-existing, documented in ADR-0035:168; no Traefik
  dynamic route exists for the host. Out of scope here; noted so it is not re-diagnosed.
- **#3 Weaviate client-close race** — unchanged, upstream agno; still needs the agentos-api log
  check for `WeaviateClosedClientError` / gRPC UNAVAILABLE at UI-open times.
- **#5 ADR-0038 / graphiti-core** — unimplemented, now blocked on the image-rebuild decision.

## Pending owner decisions

- ~~**Split the colliding db ids**~~ — **DECIDED + APPLIED 2026-07-31**, option (a).
- **Deploy the #1 fix to prod** — WHAT: merge `fix/review-hardening-adr36-40` and redeploy the
  exec tier. WHY: the fix is committed locally only; prod is still broken. SHORTCOMING: the
  pre-deploy gate above (does the UI send `db_id`?) is unverified, so this should be a
  check-then-deploy, not a blind deploy.
- **Graphiti image rebuild** — WHAT/WHY/options in `docs/planning/graphiti-image-rebuild-plan.md`
  §8 and its "Open decisions for the owner". Three questions: approve the rebuild; enable GLiNER2
  (CPU-local NER, cheaper hot path, costs model download + memory); upstream-PR identity.
  RECOMMENDATION: approve the rebuild — it deletes two of four hotfixes and unblocks ADR-0038.
- **Case Bible scope** — WHAT: decide sort completion vs vault scaffold vs lakehouse vs all.
  WHY: workstream 3 cannot start without it. No recommendation — owner-only call.

## Open workstreams (owner order)

1. **[in_progress] Memory/knowledge systems** — this audit → live checks → apply #1 fix → #2 lock regen → #4 docs → #5 schedule graphiti-core.
2. **[pending] TraceIQ → Agno knowledge tie-in** — HANDOFF-2026-07-27 Phase 3 task 2: TraceIQ facts → Graphiti w/ provenance + node-count landing gate.
3. **[pending] Finish the Case Bible** — scope with owner first (sort completion vs vault scaffold vs lakehouse vs all). Use case-bible:* skills; architect governs structure.

## Owner working-style contract (REQUIRED)

- **Structured replies always**: bullets, labeled Observation/Question/Recommendation blocks, white space, answer-first (owner ADHD; in global CLAUDE.md; hyperfocus plugin flow-mode when loaded).
- Confirm before changes; never hard-delete (quarantine); byline every artifact; verify before claiming done.

## Tooling notes for next session

- smart-explore engine: `bash /c/Users/matts/.agents/skills/smart-explore/se` — this repo is already indexed in the central store (search/outline/unfold/refs --lsp/imports/changed all work).
- /smart-explore command: history-digest (Step 1.5) + log-arbitrated contradiction sweep (Step 3) are wired in.
- Contradiction-arbitration rule: newest owner-approved statement wins (owner corrections > newer docs > older docs > code comments).
