## What this is

The three-layer picture of the Agno-MCP-Platform ingest + knowledge system — the diagram that
replaces re-explaining the architecture. Current reality and the ADR-0051 target, side by side.

## One-paragraph system summary

Source files (evidence, SMS, AI chats) are meant to flow through **one** pipeline: **SBV** parses
and previews, hands off to an **extraction** stage (chunk → multipass → entities → timeline)
triggered by **Postgres change-detection**, then **HITL** verifies before anything becomes canonical
— landing in **five knowledge lanes** (platform · legal · personal_history · context · evidence),
with relationship history inside personal_history and evidence remaining custody-only.
**Today** that full pipeline is not built: the Swift neutral-ingest path and a disposable
Semantica candidate worker now exist, but Semantica is not connected to PostgreSQL
change-detection or deployed, and remaining legacy paths still require convergence.

| 2 — Structure | [structure.md](structure.md) | Five-lane knowledge ERD · parser registry · agent→lane map |
| 3 — Features | [features.md](features.md) | Conversation→timeline flow · feature hierarchy |
