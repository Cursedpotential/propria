## Totals

**208/213 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 BLOCKED**

BLOCKED = a capability that is genuinely not deployed, with the owner action named. It is not a defect in this plugin and does not count as a FAIL.

- fn: run 5b51b738 - 82/82 pass, 0 fail, 0 blocked
-    store rows before: {'harness_documents': 17, 'harness_documents_not_retracted': 0, 'harness_handoffs_not_retracted': 0, 'decision_log_test_rows': 134}
-    store rows after : {'harness_documents': 23, 'harness_documents_not_retracted': 0, 'harness_handoffs_not_retracted': 0, 'decision_log_test_rows': 158}
- skill: run 6186b03a - 52/55 pass, 0 fail, 3 blocked
- mcp: run 31e8897c - 74/76 pass, 0 fail, 2 blocked

Reproduce with:

```
cd <repo root>
"C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe" scripts/docstore/test_plugin.py --only fn
"C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe" scripts/docstore/test_plugin.py --only skill
"C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe" scripts/docstore/test_plugin.py --only mcp
```

## Remaining FAILs (defects)

**None.**
