"""Submit intake to the neutral ingest port; inspect its PostgreSQL run receipt.

New in the workbench — the C1 Operator Console's replacement for the
promote-as-a-blind-box UX (service/promote.py). This module never touches
Milvus/Postgres/LanceDB-chunks itself; it only forwards to the spine's own
HTTP API (a parallel build, contract assumed per the build brief — see
module-level docstrings below for the exact assumptions) and returns the
spine's response verbatim.

Two ways to start a run:
- `staged_id` — an existing LanceDB `staged_files` row; its original bytes
  are fetched from the object store (repo/object_store_client) and
  forwarded as the multipart file.
- `file_bytes` + `filename` — a fresh upload forwarded directly, without
  ever landing in the staging table (the New-run dialog's "drop a file"
  path can skip staging entirely).

C2 (supervised-gate controls) adds three more passthroughs against a run
that already exists — continue_run/abort_run/retry_run — plus an optional
`custody_tier` on start_run. All contract details (status codes, response
shapes, gate semantics) are per the console/c2-spine build brief, a
parallel branch this module codes against but does not implement:

- `status='paused'` + `gate_state='waiting'` means the run is stopped at a
  gate; the NEXT pending stage (by seq) is the gated one.
- POST /v1/runs/{id}/continue -> 200 {run_id, status}; 409 if not paused.
- POST /v1/runs/{id}/abort -> 200 {run_id, status:'failed'}; 409 on terminal.
- POST /v1/runs/{id}/retry -> 202 {run_id: NEW, parent_run_id}; only
  terminal-failed runs are retryable.
- POST /v1/runs accepts `custody_tier` ('full' | 'light'); the spine
  defaults it per-workflow when omitted (chat-transcript -> light,
  sms-xml -> full), so it's forwarded only when the caller set one.
