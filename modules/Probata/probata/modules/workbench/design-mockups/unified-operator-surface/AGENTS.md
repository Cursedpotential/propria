# Prototype Instructions

> _Byline: Codex · GPT-5.6 · 2026-08-27 (prototype decision note)._

Owner-approved visual direction: graphite application shell, warm light workspace, compact
operations density, plain-language labels, and a light/dark theme control. The first prototype is
deliberately limited to one complete browser-local intake preview and decision slice. Do not add
inactive dashboards, advanced-workspace destinations, or backend claims before those paths are
actually wired.

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.
