"""Structural PDF repair via QPDF (pikepdf) — rebuild the file, not the text.

This is REPAIR, not extraction. `server/tools/extractors/extract_text.py` reads
text out of a PDF that already opens; this module deals with a PDF that does
NOT open — a damaged cross-reference table, a missing trailer, a truncated
tail, a broken object stream. Extraction cannot run until this has.

WHY QPDF
--------
A PDF's cross-reference table maps object numbers to byte offsets and lives at
the END of the file. Damage it and every object becomes unreachable even though
the object bytes are still sitting there intact. QPDF's recovery scans the
whole file for object markers and REBUILDS that table from what it finds, which
is why a file that no reader will open often still yields all of its pages.
pikepdf is the Python binding and ships libqpdf in its wheels, so there is no
system package to install.

THE CUSTODY RULE THIS MODULE ENFORCES
-------------------------------------
Repairing a PDF necessarily produces DIFFERENT BYTES — unlike the XML/CSV/JSON
paths, where repair happens in the parse and the file on disk is never touched.
Different bytes mean a different H1, and H1 is the custody anchor.

So `repair_pdf()` REFUSES to write over its input. It always produces a new,
derived artifact, and it records the sha256 of both sides so the derivation is
provable: "exhibit N-repaired was produced from exhibit N (sha256 abc...) by
QPDF 12.x on this date, and here is what QPDF reported it had to reconstruct."
An in-place repair would destroy the original and silently break the chain.

Repair is therefore always LOSSY severity at the artifact level: not because
content is necessarily lost, but because the resulting file is a
RECONSTRUCTION and must never inherit the original's authority unexamined.
