"""server/tools/repair — streaming repair + structural chunking for damaged text.

Byline: Claude Code . Opus 5 (1M) . 2026-08-02

Repairs the three text formats this corpus arrives in — XML, JSON, CSV (plus
HTML and NDJSON) — by routing each to a battle-tested engine and streaming
structural chunks out of it. See `AGENTS.md` in this directory for the design
rules; the short version:

    1. NEVER read a whole file. Every path here streams.
    2. NEVER write a repaired file back. Repair is in-memory, at parse time.
       The artifact of record stays the original bytes, because H1 is computed
       over them and a rewritten file breaks the custody chain.
    3. NEVER repair silently. Every fix is a RepairEvent with a severity, and
       `lossy` severity means evidence could have been lost.
    4. NEVER import a repair library at module scope (facade constraint —
       see engines.py).

Typical use:

    from pathlib import Path
    from server.tools.repair import detect, iter_chunks, RepairReport

    report = RepairReport()
    for chunk in iter_chunks(Path(p), report=report):
        if chunk.ok:
            handle(chunk.node)          # Element / dict / row
    print(report.summary())             # -> funnel counters for the ingest ledger

Import order below is dependency order on purpose: `engines` imports `chunkers`,
so binding `chunkers` first keeps the package's own partial initialisation from
mattering.
