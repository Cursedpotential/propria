"""What to DO with a damaged file: rewrite it clean, flag it, quarantine it.

Byline: Claude Code . Opus 5 (1M) . 2026-08-02

Owner directive 2026-08-02: *"Write a new repaired file and quarantine the
damaged file. Or at the very least flag it as damaged so that it doesn't
continue being parsed out."*

Three escalating actions, and the DEFAULT IS THE SAFEST ONE:

    flag       append to a damage ledger. Touches nothing on disk. Ingest
               consults the ledger and skips/routes flagged artifacts, so a
               damaged file stops being silently re-parsed on every run.
    rewrite    stream the repaired chunks into a NEW clean file elsewhere.
               The original is not modified.
    quarantine create a verified copy in a quarantine tree and ledger-block
               the retained original. Opt-in, dry-run by default.

WHY QUARANTINE IS NOT THE DEFAULT
---------------------------------
Two standing rules govern quarantining evidence:
  * never delete — the original remains under owner control;
  * a full recursive manifest precedes any copy job, and approval is explicit
    and never inferred.
So `quarantine_file()` refuses to act unless `dry_run=False` is passed
deliberately, and `plan_quarantine()` exists to produce the manifest first.

The SHA-keyed flag is what stops re-parsing; no recorded source path is broken.

THE LEDGER IS KEYED BY sha256
-----------------------------
Paths move; content does not. Keying on the hash means a flagged artifact stays
flagged after a reorganisation, and re-flagging the same bytes under a new path
updates one entry rather than creating a phantom second damaged file.
