"""Atomic tool: iMessage PDF -> NormalizedRecords (via text extraction + the TXT grammar).

ReagentX/imessage-exporter has NO native PDF exporter, so an iMessage PDF is a
PRINT-TO-PDF of the TXT (or HTML) output — it carries a real text layer. So we:
  1. extract the text layer natively (pypdf -> pdfplumber). These PDFs are
     born-digital, so the native layer is present; the general OCR pool
     (tools/extract_text.py, capability extract.text) is only for SCANNED docs.
  2. route the extracted text through imessage_txt.parse_txt_text() — the same
     timestamp/sender/body grammar engine, so PDF, TXT and HTML all normalize
     identically (tapbacks, replies, edits, read receipts preserved).

Extraction is isolated in `_extract_pdf_text` so it can be swapped to call the
shared extract.text tool (Tesseract/vision fallback) for scanned variants later.
Capability parse.imessage; siblings imessage_txt.py / imessage_html.py.
