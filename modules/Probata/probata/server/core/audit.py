core/audit.py — the ONE writer of ``ops.audit_ledger`` (ADR-0047 / D-042).

Owner ruling 2026-08-09 (R-1, ratified as ADR-0047, accepted/signed same day):
"every decision, every action, every modification, every read — everything
needs to be audited, with that information on my call." This module is the
single insert path for that ledger — nothing else may write
``ops.audit_ledger`` (mirrors ``server/evidence/custody.py``'s sole-writer
contract for the ``evidence`` schema).

Public surface
--------------
``record()``            — the ONLY insert path. Every other helper here
                           (``record_custody_ref``, ``record_read``,
                           ``record_approval``, ``audit_tool_hook``) is a thin
                           wrapper around it.
``verify_chain()``       — walks the whole chain and re-derives every
                           ``entry_hash``; raises ``AuditChainError`` LOUDLY
                           on the first mismatch. Intended call sites (not
                           wired here — outside this module's scope):
                           ``server/api/main.py``'s ``lifespan()`` (startup)
                           and the S9 backup cycle (ADR-0047 consequences).
``record_custody_ref()`` — log a ``write`` row that REFERENCES an
                           ``evidence.custody_event`` id rather than
                           duplicating its detail (ADR-0047 decision 4:
                           "one fact, one home").
``record_read()``        — the ``read`` INTERFACE (ADR-0047 decision 4 /
                           S5 handoff task 5): S6 lands the per-lane hooks
                           (Postgres wrapper, KnowledgeHandle/Weaviate,
                           Graphiti client, MCP doors) that call this.
``record_approval()``    — approval-resolution logging. agno's native
                           ``/approvals`` router is auto-mounted from
                           installed ``agno.os.routers.approvals.router``
                           (NOT vendored, not in this repo's file scope) and
                           has no hook parameter — wiring this helper in
                           cleanly needs either a thin wrapper around the
                           ``os_db`` handed to ``AgentOS(db=admin_db, ...)``
                           in ``server/api/main.py`` (wrap
                           ``admin_db.update_approval`` to call
                           ``record_approval()`` after a successful
                           resolve) or ASGI middleware on
                           ``POST /approvals/{id}/resolve``. That edit is
                           OUTSIDE this module's file scope (S5 handoff:
                           "if the native /approvals surface has no clean
                           hook point without invasive changes, implement

                           documented here for S6, not wired.
``audit_tool_hook()``    — the agno-native ``tool_hooks`` callable (ADR-0047
                           decision 4: "tool invocations via agno tool_hooks
                           — native, never a custom interception layer").
                           Wired onto every Agent/Team ``server.agents.
                           factory.build_agent_team()`` constructs — see
                           that function's integration-point comment.

No raw case content — ever
---------------------------
Every argument that ends up in a ledger row must be a hash, an id, or a
short structural fact (a byte count, a schema name) — NEVER message text,
file contents, tool-call payload bytes, or anything a court would call
"the evidence itself". ``payload_hash`` exists so callers can prove *what*
was read/written/called without the ledger ever holding *what it says*.
This is enforced by convention and by this docstring, not by a runtime
content filter (there is no reliable way to detect "is this string case
content" after the fact) — every caller is responsible for hashing before
calling ``record()``. The one runtime guard this module DOES apply:
``payload_hash``/``prev_hash``/``entry_hash`` must look like hex digests,
which incidentally also catches "someone passed raw text as payload_hash".

Chain design
------------
``entry_hash = sha256(prev_hash + canonical_json(business_fields))`` where
``business_fields`` is the sorted-keys JSON of
``{ts, actor, action_type, object_schema, object_ref, horizon_context,
base_version, payload_hash}`` — NOT including ``prev_hash`` itself (that is
prepended raw, matching the S5 handoff spec literally) or the ``id`` (insertion
order already fixes the chain's position; hashing the identity-assigned id
would make the hash depend on a value chosen by Postgres rather than by the
event).

Unlike ``evidence.custody_event`` (whose chain hash is computed in a DB
TRIGGER — ``evidence.chain_custody_event``, see
``sql/bootstrap/schema_baseline.sql``), this ledger's hash is computed HERE,
in application code, before the row is ever sent to Postgres. That is a
deliberate reversal, not an oversight: the trigger approach chains PER
``source_id`` (one custody subject, one lock key); this ledger is ONE global
chain across every actor and action type, so the serialization boundary has
to be the whole table, and holding that boundary in a DB trigger would still
need the same PostgreSQL-side advisory lock this module takes explicitly —
doing it in Python keeps the single-writer contract (and the "only
``record()`` may INSERT this table" contract) visible in one place instead of
split across a Python caller and a SQL trigger body.

Concurrency: two overlapping transactions must never observe the same
"current last row" and both compute the same ``prev_hash`` — that would fork
the chain. A bare ``SELECT ... ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE`` does NOT
prevent this at READ COMMITTED: the row it locks is the OLD last row, which
is never itself UPDATEd by the next INSERT, so a blocked-then-unblocked
waiter still reads stale (pre-INSERT) data once it gets the lock — it does
not get re-pointed at the row the other transaction just committed. This
module instead takes a single-key transaction-scoped advisory lock
(``pg_advisory_xact_lock``) BEFORE reading the last row — the same pattern
already in-tree for ``evidence.custody_event`` (``evidence.chain_custody_event``
locks ``hashtextextended(NEW.source_id::text, 0)`` before its own
prev-digest lookup). Whichever transaction acquires the lock first serializes
every reader/writer behind it; the lock is released automatically at
COMMIT/ROLLBACK (``_xact`` — no explicit unlock needed, and none is skipped
by an exception).

    Parameters
    ----------
    action_type:
        One of ``ACTION_TYPES`` (``decision``, ``write``, ``read``,
        ``tool_call``, ``approval``, ``derivation`` — ADR-0047 decision 1).
    object_ref:
        A reference into ``object_schema`` — a row id, a
        ``custody_event.id``, an approval id, a tool name — NEVER content.
    actor:
        Who/what performed the action (agent id, ``"owner"``, a tool name,
        a script name). Required — this is a single-operator platform, but
        every ledger row still names its actor (owner ruling: never
        multi-user fields, but "actor" here is attribution, not a user
        account).
    ctx:
        ``horizon_context`` — ``{case_id, pass_id, horizon, actor}`` or a
        caller-defined dict of the same shape. ``None`` means an explicit
        hindsight grant (ADR-0047 decision 1) — NOT "unknown"; callers that
        genuinely don't know the horizon should still pass an empty dict,
        not rely on ``None``'s hindsight meaning by accident.

        For a ``read`` row (see ``record_read()``): this MUST be the
        ``HorizonContext`` actually used to filter/serve that read — this
        is the field a future "what could the agent see and when" audit
        query reads.
    object_schema:
        The schema the event concerns (``"evidence"``, ``"working"``,
        ...). Optional — a bare ``tool_call`` with no DB object has none.
    base_version:
        The version/generation this event was computed against (derivation
        provenance, ADR-0045 condition 3). Optional elsewhere.
    payload_hash:
        sha256 hex digest of whatever payload this event carries. NEVER
        the raw payload. Optional (some events, e.g. a bare read of a
        single row by id, may have nothing worth hashing beyond
        ``object_ref`` itself).
    engine:
        Override the SQLAlchemy engine (tests use this to point at a
        scratch DB). Defaults to the lazy module-level engine.
    connection:
        Existing SQLAlchemy connection whose surrounding transaction must
        also contain this audit row. This is used when an authoritative
        action and its audit entry must commit atomically. Mutually exclusive
        with ``engine``; callers retain transaction ownership.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The new row's ``id``.

    Raises
    ------

    Hooks run wrapped-innermost-first when more than one is registered
    (``_build_nested_execution_chain``'s ``reduce`` over reversed hooks).
    Sync-only: agno silently skips async hooks when the tool call itself is
    sync (``execute()``'s ``iscoroutinefunction`` filter) — this hook is
    synchronous so it always runs.

    Logs ONE ``tool_call`` ledger row per invocation: the tool name, a
    sha256 of the CANONICALIZED (sorted-keys JSON) arguments — never the
    raw arguments, which may carry case content (ADR-0047 decision 3) — and
    the result size (``len()`` of the stringified result, never the result
    itself). Actor is the calling agent/team id when agno supplies one,
    else the tool name.

    Audit-write failures are NOT swallowed: ADR-0047's "no sampling, no
    tiering, no exceptions — an exception list is where audit trails go to
    die" reads as a promise that a broken audit path fails the action it
    was supposed to audit, not one that silently drops it. If
    ``ops.audit_ledger`` is unreachable, the tool call raises instead of
    completing unaudited.
