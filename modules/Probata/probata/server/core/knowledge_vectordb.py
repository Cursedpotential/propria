"""server/core/knowledge_vectordb.py — fail loudly on a dead embedder.

THE BUG (measured live 2026-08-01): the AgentOS Knowledge panel showed content
rows reporting ``COMPLETED`` with ZERO vectors written. Root cause, traced
through agno 2.8.0's actual source (not assumed):

1. ``agno.knowledge.embedder.openai.OpenAIEmbedder.get_embedding_and_usage()``
   (and its async twin) catch ANY exception from the embeddings call — a dead
   API key, 402 out-of-credits, a 400 "model does not exist", a gateway
   outage — log a warning, and return ``(None, None)``. They never raise.
2. ``agno.knowledge.document.base.Document.embed()``/``async_embed()`` then
   just set ``self.embedding = None``. No exception either.
3. ``agno.vectordb.weaviate.Weaviate.insert()``/``async_insert()`` check
   ``if document.embedding is None: log_error(...); continue`` — they SKIP
   the document and keep going. Still no exception.
4. Control returns normally to ``agno.knowledge.Knowledge._handle_vector_db_insert``/
   ``_ahandle_vector_db_insert``, which only catches an exception FROM the
   vector-db call — since none was raised, it unconditionally sets
   ``content.status = ContentStatus.COMPLETED``.

Net effect: an embedding-provider outage is completely invisible at the
content-row level. This was VERIFIED as the live cause on 2026-08-01: the
platform's embed lane defaulted to OpenRouter for the text embedder
(``nvidia/nv-embed-v1``), which OpenRouter does not host (400 "Model
nvidia/nv-embed-v1 does not exist") — see the accompanying fix in
``server/core/session.py`` for the provider-routing half of this bug.

THE FIX (this module): ``VerifiedWeaviate`` wraps ``insert``/``async_insert``
(which ``agno.vectordb.weaviate.Weaviate.upsert``/``async_upsert`` delegate to
internally via ``self.insert``/``self.async_insert``, so overriding just these
two covers all four insert/upsert paths) and checks, AFTER the base
implementation returns, whether at least one document in the batch actually
got a vector. If EVERY document in the batch has ``embedding is None``, it
raises ``EmbeddingFailedError`` instead of returning normally. That exception
propagates straight into agno's own ``_handle_vector_db_insert``/
``_ahandle_vector_db_insert`` exception handler — the SAME code path that
already correctly marks content ``FAILED`` with a status message today. No
agno internals are patched; this only adds a post-condition check on top of
the public ``Weaviate`` API.

A PARTIAL failure (some but not all documents embedded) is not raised as an
error — agno's chunk-level retry story doesn't exist, so failing the whole
content row for a partial success would throw away real, usable vectors. It
is logged loudly instead so an operator can see the partial-embed rate.

        Why it presented as "ingest silently does nothing": the ingest path is
        entirely async (``Knowledge.ainsert`` -> ``async_upsert`` ->
        ``async_insert``), while search/inspection is sync. So the sync client

        agno catches that per document and the content row lands FAILED with
        the generic "Could not upsert embedding", giving no hint that the host
        was wrong. Verified: 4 files reindexed, 4 rows FAILED, Weaviate object

        until this is fixed there is no way to view raw chunk content through
        AgentOS itself (only by querying Weaviate directly, which is how this
        bug was found and confirmed live).

        Fix: call the upstream implementation unchanged, then zip its output
        1:1 against ``response.objects`` (identical order — both iterate the
        same list once) and fill in each missing ``id`` from that object's own
        Weaviate UUID: the exact identifier ``Weaviate.insert()``/``upsert()``
        assigned at write time (``doc_uuid = uuid.UUID(hex=record_id[:32])``),
