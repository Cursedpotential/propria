Database Session
================

``get_agno_db()``  — Agno OPERATIONAL store (sessions/memory/metrics/eval/culture/traces/spans)
                     on **PostgresDb** (ONE ``db_id="agentos-db"``; flatten executed 2026-08-04
                     per ADR-0043 decision 3). SurrealDB is parked read-only, off the critical
                     path (docstring corrected 2026-08-09 to match the code below).
``get_postgres_db()`` — Postgres for Knowledge *contents* rows and pg_duckdb / evidence work.
``create_knowledge()`` — agent Knowledge vectors. CURRENT CONTRACT (ADR-0040, owner-locked
2026-07; HANDOFF-2026-07-27): **Weaviate is the platform vector store** — CUTOVER DONE
2026-07-29 (Phase-1 task 4): vectors write to data-weaviate; Milvus (ADR-0026/0027) is
SIDELINED for memsearch only and no longer referenced here. pgvector remains in the PG
image but is NOT the Knowledge store.

Embedder: the live text contract is a symmetric model, so no query/passage modes are sent
here. (Asymmetric NIM embedqa models are NOT banned — owner correction 2026-08-07: they
require a per-call ``input_type``; this Agno client path cannot pass one, so they are
inapplicable *here* only.) LIVE contract since 2026-07-19: ``nvidia/nv-embed-v1``
(4096-d) for text — the live store already holds 4096-d nv-embed-v1 vectors (handoff
verified-live table). Code = ``codestral-embed-2505`` (1536-d). One collection per embedder
(ADR-0010); the embedder/dim is fixed at collection creation — changing it means dropping +
re-creating (re-embedding) the collection. (NVIDIA ``NimEmbedder`` fallback retained.)

Config via env:
  SurrealDB (parked read-only since 2026-08-04, legacy access only): ``SURREALDB_URL`` /
    ``SURREALDB_USER`` / ``SURREALDB_PASS`` / ``SURREALDB_NS`` / ``SURREALDB_DB``.
  Weaviate (vectors): ``WEAVIATE_HTTP_HOST`` / ``WEAVIATE_HTTP_PORT`` / ``WEAVIATE_GRPC_PORT``
    / ``WEAVIATE_API_KEY`` (empty = anonymous until Phase-1 task 5).
  Embedder: text defaults to NVIDIA NIM (``NVIDIA_BASE_URL`` / ``NVIDIA_API_KEY``); code
    defaults to OpenRouter (``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` + optional ``OPENROUTER_BASE_URL``).
    ``EMBED_BASE_URL`` / ``EMBED_API_KEY`` override BOTH when set (2026-08-01 fix — see
    the comment above ``_EMBED_TEXT_BASE_URL`` for the live-verified incident this closes).

# ONE registry id, ONE backend (2026-08-04 flatten — ADR-0043 decision 3, plus
# Codex: "consolidate AgentOS operational/admin/content/learning state behind one
# PostgreSQL-backed Agno database object").
#
# History, so the reversal is understood rather than repeated: three ids existed
# because agno registers dbs keyed by `db.id` (os/app.py) and its resolver counts
# registry KEYS (os/utils.py) — sharing ONE id across a SurrealDb and a PostgresDb
# merged two different backends into one bucket and made memory/session/knowledge
# routes resolve by registration lottery (HANDOFF-2026-07-30 audit #1). Splitting
# the ids fixed that but left three registered, which armed agno's `len(dbs) > 1`
# gate: every route omitting `db_id` returned 400, papered over by
# install_db_id_default().
#
# Collapsing onto ONE PostgresDb removes the whole class of problem: one backend
# cannot lose a lottery, and one id cannot arm the multi-db gate. SurrealDB leaves
# the critical path — its 359 operational rows (200 spans, 139 traces, 17
# sessions, 3 memories, 0 users) were exported with sha256 manifests to
# _stale/surreal-export-20260804 and /data/agno/backups/ on 2026-08-04; the

# --- Embedder: OpenAI-compatible /embeddings, SYMMETRIC ----------------------
# Dedicated EMBED_BASE_URL / EMBED_API_KEY, when set, override EVERYTHING below
# for BOTH embedders — an explicit operator escape hatch that moves the whole
# embedding lane to a single provider WITHOUT touching OPENROUTER_API_KEY
# (settings.py also reads that var for LLM provider selection).
#
# Per-embedder PROVIDER DEFAULTS (bug fixed 2026-08-01 — see incident note
# below): the text embedder (``nvidia/nv-embed-v1``) is an NVIDIA NIM model;
# OpenRouter does NOT host it. The code embedder (``codestral-embed-2505``)
# IS OpenRouter-hosted. Before this fix, BOTH embedders defaulted to
# OpenRouter (settings.py's own docstring already documented text=NVIDIA,
# code=OpenRouter — session.py just didn't implement it), so every text-embed
# call with no EMBED_BASE_URL override hit OpenRouter, which 400s
# ``Model nvidia/nv-embed-v1 does not exist`` (verified live 2026-08-01) —
# and separately the configured OpenRouter key had no credits either (402 on
# an OpenRouter-native embedding model, verified same day). agno's embedder
# swallows that failure and returns (None, None) instead of raising (see
# ``agno.knowledge.embedder.openai.OpenAIEmbedder.get_embedding_and_usage``),
# so every knowledge ingest silently wrote ZERO vectors while still reporting
# ContentStatus.COMPLETED — the "COMPLETED with no vectors" bug. Direct calls
# to NVIDIA NIM (``NVIDIA_BASE_URL`` + ``NVIDIA_API_KEY``) for nv-embed-v1
# verified live 2026-08-01: HTTP 200, real 4096-d vector, matching the store's
# existing embedded rows exactly.
#
# TODO (owner decision 2026-08-01, tracked docs/DEBT.md): this hits NVIDIA NIM
# DIRECT, not through the Portkey gateway. Direct is deliberate for now —
# Portkey embeddings routing needs its own wiring pass. When that lands, this
# is a straight repoint, no new mechanism required: agno's OpenAIEmbedder
# already forwards ``client_params`` into the underlying OpenAI client
# constructor, which accepts ``default_headers`` — the exact hook Portkey's
# own `graphiti-portkeyfix` sidecar exists to work around for graphiti_core
# (which has NO such hook; agno's client DOES, so we don't need a sidecar).
# The target config already exists and is verified live: `docker/gateway/
# portkey/configs/embed.json` (NVIDIA nv-embed-v1, 4096-d, dimension-locked,
# same model/dim this module already pins) — reused as-is by Graphiti's own
# Portkey cutover (docker/gateway/portkey/README.md, "Graphiti cutover" §).
# Migration shape: point ``_EMBED_TEXT_BASE_URL`` at the Portkey gateway
# (``http://100.72.169.40:8787/v1``, ADR-0042) and pass
# ``client_params={"base_url": ..., "default_headers": {"x-portkey-config":
# json.dumps(<embed.json contents>)}}`` from ``_embedder()``. Do this only
# once Portkey's own embeddings passthrough is verified for OUR call shape
