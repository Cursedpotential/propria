"""Default the ``db_id`` query parameter on agno routes that accept one.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-01, HANDOFF-2026-07-30 audit #1 follow-through)
=======================================================================
agno's ``AgentOS`` registers databases in a ``dict[str, list[db]]`` keyed by
``db.id`` (``agno/os/app.py::_register_db_with_validation``) and its route
resolver decides "is this a multi-db setup?" by counting **keys**
(``agno/os/utils.py``)::

    if len(dbs) > 1:
        raise HTTPException(400, "The db_id query parameter is required when using multiple databases")

That single line gives us two failure modes and no good default:

* **One shared id** (what we had until ``9a7e4ac``): the guard never fires and
  the resolver returns ``all_dbs[0]`` — the *first-registered* backend,
  regardless of which one actually owns the requested table. Memory, session
  and knowledge routes resolved by registration-order lottery. This was the
  root cause of the "memory/knowledge broken on first open" breakage.
* **Distinct ids** (correct, applied in ``9a7e4ac``): the guard now fires, and
  because ``db_id`` is ``Optional[str] = Query(default=None)`` on *every* one
  of these routes, any client that omits it gets a hard **400** where it
  previously got a silently-wrong **200**.

Neither is acceptable on its own. This middleware supplies the missing third
option: when a request hits a route that accepts ``db_id`` and does not carry
one, inject the operational store's id. Routing becomes **deliberate** rather
than a lottery or an error, and clients that *do* send ``db_id`` are untouched.

Verified against ``agno==2.8.0`` (the pinned prod version) by
``scratchpad/db_id_gate_probe.py``: one shared id -> 200, three ids -> 400.

DESIGN NOTES
------------
* Target routes are discovered by **inspecting endpoint signatures** for a
  ``db_id`` parameter, not by hard-coding paths. agno adds and renames routes
  between minor versions; a path allowlist would rot silently and reintroduce
  the 400.
* Only routes agno itself declares with ``db_id`` are touched. Knowledge routes
  prefer ``knowledge_id`` (which uniquely identifies an instance even when
  several share a database), so a request already carrying ``knowledge_id`` is
  left alone.
* The default is applied to the *query string in the ASGI scope* before the
  route's dependency resolution runs, so agno sees an ordinary explicit
  ``db_id`` and no agno code needs patching.

    Route trees are NOT flat, and the shape is FastAPI-version dependent. With
    the ``base_app=`` pattern agno uses, ``app.routes`` holds mostly
    ``fastapi.routing._IncludedRouter`` objects — a private class that exposes
    NEITHER ``.routes`` NOR ``.endpoint``, only ``.original_router``. A naive
    ``isinstance(r, APIRoute)`` scan over ``app.routes`` therefore matches
    ZERO routes and this guard silently protects nothing.

    That is not hypothetical: it shipped. On 2026-08-01 the first deploy of this
    middleware logged "installed on NO routes" in prod while the same code
    matched 48 routes in a bare ``AgentOS(agents=...)`` test — because the test
    did not use ``base_app=``. Live topology was 17 APIRoute + 21
    _IncludedRouter + 1 Mount + 4 Route at top level, with all 48 db_id routes
    hidden one level down. Hence: descend generically, never assume a shape.

    Yields ``(prefix, route)``. ``prefix`` is the mount path a nested route sits
    behind — a mounted sub-app's ``route.path`` is RELATIVE to its mount, so
    matching it against the absolute request path silently fails without it.
