"""agents/factory.py — agent/team constructors for the MCP Platform.

Every Agent and Team is built by a ``build_<name>()`` function in this file.
The top-level ``build_agent_team(ctx)`` assembles the full topology and returns
a dict keyed by stable public name (UI/tests depend on these keys).

Architecture::

    Root Router (mode=route)
    +-- Platform Ops (mode=coordinate)
    |   +-- ingestion_orchestrator
    |   +-- analysis_orchestrator
    |   +-- review_gatekeeper
    |   +-- transcript_miner
    +-- Builder (mode=coordinate)
    |   +-- dev_copilot
    |   +-- project_pal
    |   +-- forensic_data_agent
    +-- document_digest  (conditional, GOOGLE_API_KEY)

Conventions:
- All functions use ``from __future__ import annotations`` + full type hints.
- Agent ``id=`` is a STABLE PUBLIC CONTRACT — never change it without updating
  every consumer (UI, tests, docs).
- Instructions come from ``agents/instructions.py`` via ``get_instructions(key)``.
- The HITL write tool (``apply_db_modification``) is the ONLY way agents write
  to the ``analysis`` schema. It pauses for human approval before executing.
