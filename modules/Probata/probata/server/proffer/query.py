"""PostgreSQL read model for Workbench knowledge visibility.

This module exposes canonical rows and their custody provenance without
depending on Agno or a vector-store projection.

Byline: Codex · GPT-5 · 2026-08-16
Byline amendment: Codex · GPT-5 · 2026-08-18 (source records and derived chunks split)
Byline amendment: Claude Code · Opus 5 · 2026-09-05 (H-04 -- chunks are read from
``working.content_chunk`` through the ``working.content_chunk_message`` bridge;
``working.normalized_record_chunk`` was dropped by 0058 per D-116, so both queries
here were reading a table that does not exist.  Shape changes that follow from the
successor table, not from taste: ``char_start``/``char_end``/``attrs`` have no
successor column on ``content_chunk`` (typed span lineage lives in
``working.content_chunk_source_span``, out of scope here) and are gone;
``derived_at`` is ``content_chunk.created_at``; ``chunker_id`` comes from
``content_chunk_generation``; ``source_content_sha256`` comes from the message row;
``is_center``, ``member_position`` and ``derivation_mode`` are new and real.)
