"""
evidence/workflows.py — named, custody-gated workflows on native agno.workflow.

A workflow = ordered capability steps (custody -> parse -> normalize+store ->
knowledge). Each parse step resolves the best-fit atomic tool from the
registry; if the preferred tool rejects the input (wrong format), the executor
tries the next same-capability candidate automatically and reports every
attempt — the substitution mechanic the mesh is built around.

Workflows registered here:
  chat-transcript : AI-chat exports (ChatGPT / claude.ai / Claude Code JSONL /
                    markdown) -> custody -> parse -> working.normalized_record
                    -> knowledge engine (domain-tagged). THE BOOTSTRAP VERTICAL.

  sms-xml         : "SMS Backup & Restore" XML (sms/mms/call) -> custody ->
                    parse.sms-xml (primary = SBV since PR #18 / aacf21c 2026-08-06;
                    the 2026-08-02 demotion was LIFTED once import-scoped reads
                    landed — DECISION_LOG D-040; sms_xml.py is the pure-Python
                    FALLBACK when SBV is unwired) -> working.normalized_record ->
                    knowledge. Workflow A (the SBV vertical). Mirrors chat-transcript.

Both runners accept an optional `run_id` (C0 operator-console run ledger,
server/evidence/run_ledger.py): when set, every step is wrapped so
ops.workflow_run_stage rows land AS STAGES EXECUTE instead of only in
the end-of-run summary dict. run_id=None (the CLI's path) is unchanged.

C2 additions (`mode` + `custody_tier` params, sql/0006_run_gates_and_custody_tier.sql):
`mode='supervised'` pauses the run at a gate after every non-final stage for
an operator decision (see `_wrap_step_for_run_control`); `custody_tier`
('full' | 'light') threads through to custody_step -> ingest_artifact
(server/evidence/custody.py). Both default to their pre-C2 values, so
run_id=None / mode='auto' / custody_tier='full' callers are unchanged.

C2.6 additions (resilience + observability, 2026-07-20/21):
- `parent_run_id` (optional, threaded from server/api/run_routes.py's retry
  endpoint into ctx): when a FULL rerun's custody step dedupes (the source
  bytes are already in custody) AND the parent run's knowledge stage
  FAILED, store_step auto-routes to the same "load records from Postgres,
  re-run knowledge" path `run_knowledge_from_store` uses below, instead of
  silently reporting `docs_ingested=0` as a false success — this was a real
  prod bug (knowledge-stage failure — Weaviate since ADR-0040; historically
  Milvus 503 pre-cutover — fails knowledge -> operator retries -> custody
  dedupes -> store sees 0 NEW rows -> knowledge sees no records -> run
  reports COMPLETED with docs_ingested=0 and the knowledge docs never land).
- `run_knowledge_from_store()` — the explicit counterpart, wired off
  `POST /v1/runs/{id}/retry {"from_stage": "knowledge"}`: a child run that
  SKIPS custody/parse/store (recorded 'skipped', content "inherited from
  parent") and re-runs ONLY the knowledge stage over the parent's already-
  stored working.normalized_record rows.
- Every Step() below now sets `on_error="fail"` explicitly. agno's own
  `Step.on_error` field defaults to `OnError.skip` (its class docstring
  claims 'fail' is the default — it is not; verify against
  agno/workflow/step.py before trusting the docstring). Under the actual
  default, an UNCAUGHT exception in a step executor gets silently converted
  into a 'skipped' StepOutput (still success=False, so `_terminal_status`'s
  existing `any(success is False for s in step_results)` check already
  catches it — see tests/test_run_ledger.py) and the workflow keeps
  running with broken ctx state instead of stopping. Overriding to 'fail'
  makes an uncaught exception halt the workflow immediately instead of
  cascading into KeyErrors on later steps that assume the earlier one set
  ctx['artifact'] etc.
- Bounded exponential-backoff retry around the knowledge insert and the
  store DB write (server/evidence/store.py's `_retry_async`/`_retry_sync`)
  — every attempt lands in the stage's `output.attempts` list.
- INFO logging (logger "evidence.runs", run_id-prefixed) at run start/
  finish and every stage start/finish, with duration_s per stage and
  duration_ms in the run's finish summary.

    executor, so stage_start/stage_finish always run first, before any
    gate/abort logic below sees the stage as done.

    Two behaviors, both keyed off ops.workflow_run.gate_state:

    1. Operator ABORT check — runs at EVERY stage boundary, in BOTH 'auto'
       and 'supervised' mode (one cheap read_gate() call): POST
       /v1/runs/{id}/abort on a RUNNING run only sets gate_state='abort' (it
       does not — and, by single-writer design, must not — call finish_run
       itself); this is the code that actually observes that flag and stops
       the run. This is the "wrapper honors it at the next gate/stage
       boundary" limitation the C2 task spec calls out explicitly: an abort
       requested mid-stage-execution is NOT preemptive — the in-flight
       step's executor always runs to completion first, and if that stage
       has no further boundary after it (nothing happens if the run finishes
       before this check next runs), the abort request will show up as
       gate_state='abort' forever on an otherwise-terminal run.
    2. Supervised PAUSE-FOR-APPROVAL — 'supervised' mode ONLY, and only
       after a stage that is NOT the last one (there is nothing left to gate
       into after the final stage): pauses the run (status='paused',
       gate_state='waiting') and polls every 2s (24h ceiling) until the
       operator releases (-> resume) or aborts (-> same abort path as #1). A
       24h timeout with no decision is ALSO treated as an abort (fail closed
       rather than poll forever).

    On either abort path, ctx['gate_aborted'] is set (read by
    `_terminal_status` -> 'failed', and by the runners' finally-block to
    populate workflow_run.error), and every still-'pending' stage is marked
    'skipped' (run_ledger.skip_remaining_stages) — the stage rail should
    never show 'pending' rows once a run has a terminal status.

    unscoped /api/activity), gated out of resolve() unless SBV_PRIMARY_ENABLED is set, so the
    pure-Python parser (messages.sms-xml) is the effective primary.~~
    CORRECTED 2026-08-10: the demotion was LIFTED. Its restore condition (import-scoped reads)
    was delivered by PR #18 (aacf21c, 2026-08-06), so SBV is PRIMARY again — see DECISION_LOG
    D-040. SBV_PRIMARY_ENABLED is gone; messages.sms-xml-sbv accepts .xml whenever
    _sbv_enabled() finds SBV_SERVICE_PASS wired, and the pure-Python messages.sms-xml is the
    FALLBACK for when SBV is unwired or unreachable.

    NO SILENT SUBSTITUTION (owner mandate 2026-07-02): if the PRIMARY tool fails,
    the workflow STOPS by default and says exactly what failed. Passing
    allow_fallback=True permits the substitution loop to continue autonomously,

    builder's own default stays 'full' regardless of caller.

    Re-runs ONLY the knowledge stage, over the PARENT run's already-stored
    working.normalized_record rows (`load_records_for_artifact`) — custody/
    parse/store are never touched: this run's stages 1-3 are recorded
    'skipped' with content "inherited from parent" (seeded by the caller via
    seed_stages(run_id, WORKFLOW_STAGE_NAMES[workflow]) before this runs).

    This is the direct fix for the prod bug requirement 1 describes: a full
    rerun's custody dedupe used to make the knowledge step see ZERO new
    records (nothing was parsed/stored again) and report a false success
    with docs_ingested=0 — the knowledge docs never landed. This path skips
    straight to "reload what's already stored, ingest it" so there's no
    dedupe/no-new-rows trap to fall into at all.

    Bypasses agno's Workflow/Step machinery entirely (there's only one real
    stage to run) — writes directly to the run ledger the same way
    `_wrap_step_for_ledger` would, and always calls `finish_run` in a
    `finally` block exactly like `run_chat_transcript`/`run_sms_xml` do.
