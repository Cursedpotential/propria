"""
evidence — the completed Part-1 spine (plans/logical-herding-forest.md P2).

custody  : the single entry gate (hash -> evidence row -> write-once blob)
normalize: canonical record schema (bitemporal: valid/knowledge time + tier)
store    : normalized records -> analysis schema (+ knowledge engine ingest)
workflows: named workflows on native agno.workflow (custody-gated verticals)
cli      : `python -m evidence ...`

registry + atomic parser tools live in server/tools/ (D-026) — a cross-domain
capability layer, not owned by the evidence spine (evidence/analysis/agents/
workflows/CLI all consume it). `registry` and `ToolRegistry` remain re-exported
here (lazily) for backward compatibility.

Evidence is immutable: ONLY custody.py writes the `evidence` schema, append-only.
Everything derived lands in `analysis` or the knowledge engine.

Imports are LAZY (PEP 562) so light consumers (the tools-facade container)
can use registry+parsers without dragging sqlalchemy/agno into their runtime.
