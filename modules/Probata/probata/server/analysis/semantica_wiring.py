"""Semantica worker and downstream projection wiring (design/local).

Placement decision (BOARD 2026-07-01, ADR ~0035), REVISED per ADR-0036
(accepted 2026-07-29) and ADR-0040 / HANDOFF-2026-07-27:

ADR-0043 is authoritative: the Semantica WORKER accepts immutable normalized
batches and emits candidates only. It receives no store credentials. The
historical graph/vector helpers below describe later platform-owned projectors;
they are not passed to ``server.analysis.semantica_worker``.

  * Vector projection → OUR Weaviate (data-weaviate on ovh-files, REST :8081 /
    gRPC :50051, `vectorizer: none` — we bring embeddings). Platform vector
    contract is nv-embed-v1 4096-d. Milvus is SIDELINED (ADR-0040): it stays
    up for memsearch only — no new platform writers, Semantica included.
  * Graph projection → OUR Neo4j `evidence` database only after candidate
    approval. Graphiti owns `memory`. The extraction worker writes neither.
  * Seed-first    → before Semantica extracts, we SEED it from Postgres: the
    behavioral ontology (reference.behavior_category / detection_pattern) and any
    resolved registry.entity rows. Semantica extends the seeded ontology rather
    than inventing a parallel one.

NET-NEW VALUE Semantica adds (why wire it at all): cross-source CONFLICT
detection, dedup, and decision-provenance over the evidence — lanes the current
custody->parse->normalize path does not cover.

This module builds config DICTS only. It performs NO writes and bakes NO
secrets. Worker deployment and all projection activation remain approval-gated.

> Byline: Claude Code · Fable 5 · 2026-07-29 — ADR-0036/0040 rewrite: Weaviate
> vector lane (4096-d) and isolated evidence/memory databases. Its original
> direct-writer assignment is superseded by ADR-0043 and the correction below.
> Byline: Codex · GPT-5 · 2026-08-16 — ADR-0043 correction: worker is
