"""
Eval Cases
==========

Each case sends one input to one agent and (optionally) checks two things:

- **judge** — `AgentAsJudgeEval` scores the response against `criteria`
  (binary pass/fail) using an LLM.
- **reliability** — `ReliabilityEval` checks which tools fired against
  `expected_tool_calls`.

The skeleton's web_search/code_search cases were removed with those agents
(v8.1 topology). Cases for the v8.1 agents (routing, governance, boundaries)
land with the evals phase — see docs/planning/BUILD_TODO.md Phase 12.

Add a case below, then run `python -m evals`.
