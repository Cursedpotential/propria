"""One-shot: alias the workspace and repo router files to the D-137..D-150 names.

Recall/router rule (D-142): the new name is added BESIDE the old one, never replacing it, so
either term resolves.

PROVENANCE ONLY — already run 2026-09-06 ~10:30 and superseded: the directory rename landed
2026-09-06 ~15:45 (`Agno-MCP-Platform/` is now the junction, `probata/` the real directory; see
docs/registers/RENAME-LIVE-CHANGES-2026-09-06.md §9). The substitution strings below describe
that morning's state and are kept verbatim as the record of what was applied. Do not re-run.

Run from the repo root:  uv run python scripts/rename_routers_2026_09_06.py
Byline: Claude Code · Fable 5.1 · 2026-09-06.
