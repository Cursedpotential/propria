"""Unit tests for server.contracts.records — the canonical bitemporal record.

(Promoted out of ``server/evidence/normalize.py`` in ADR-0035;
``evidence.normalize`` remains only as a deprecated re-export shim.)

The Part-2 "abuse made legible" delta filters on occurred_at / knowledge_time /
disclosure_tier, so the tz-coercion validator and finalize() defaults are
load-bearing. Both are pure and fast to test.
