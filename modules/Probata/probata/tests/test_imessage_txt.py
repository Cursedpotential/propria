"""Unit tests for server.tools.parsers.messaging.imessage_txt — imessage-exporter TXT grammar.

Reconstructs message blocks (timestamp header + sender + body), read receipts,
announcements (rename/etc.), and the call heuristic. Forensic contract: nothing
silently dropped; sender attribution and read receipts preserved.
