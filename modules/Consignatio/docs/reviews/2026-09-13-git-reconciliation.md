# Consignatio Git reconciliation — 2026-09-13

This receipt records preservation of the dirty canonical checkout at
`E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Consignatio`. The work began from local `main`
at `fa4f249a5c9d69bb7964ea851e71e8cecbab08a9`, two commits behind
`origin/main` at `1db6e9dd07a1044db3204d9efa92d3fcedf28331`.

The 52 reported dirty paths were preserved on
`codex/consignatio-preserve-20260913` and classified before staging:

| Group | Paths | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Repository and Intake routing | root and Intake `AGENTS.md` / `AGENT_MEMORY.md`, current architecture and plan documents | Review and commit as one documentation group |
| Intake Surreal graph/runtime | backend source, migrations, deployment definitions, runbooks, tests, dependency metadata, and verification receipts | Scan, test, and commit as one implementation group |
| Case Bible atomic grouping | schema, staged-path SQL, detection SQL, and the associated handoff | Review and commit as one SQL/documentation group |
| Repair-tool-kit session output | `repair-tool-kit/COMPACT-SUMMARY-2026-09-12.md` | Keep local and exclude from Git; this is generated PostCompact hook payload rather than product documentation |
| Local runtime artifact | root `version` file | Keep local and exclude from Git; binary inspection identifies a DuckDB database, not source |

Safety boundaries used throughout:

- No reset, clean, stash, broad stage, deletion, or source overwrite.
- No corpus/evidence bytes, credentials, generated databases, indexes, caches, or
  `to_be_deleted` contents may enter a commit.
- Each commit stages an explicit path list after a sensitive-content and diff check.
- Reconciliation with `origin/main` occurs only after the local groups are committed.
- The existing `codex/r2-b2-migration-reconcile-20260913` linked worktree and its
  branch are preserved; this lane does not move or rewrite that worktree.

## Validation record

- `f2106df` preserves the repository and Intake routing/documentation group.
- `393d369` preserves the Intake Surreal graph/runtime group. The backend suite passed
  all 107 tests after formatting the changed Python files; Ruff checks passed for
  every changed Python source and test in that group.
- `008129c` preserves the Case Bible atomic grouping schema, staged-path SQL,
  detection SQL, and handoff. Static review found no credential pattern. The SQL
  `DROP` uses are limited to replacing two constraints and dropping temporary
  tables on transaction completion; the scripts contain no persistent-data deletion.
- A high-confidence credential scan across all publishable changed files found no
  private key, common provider token, or credential-bearing URL pattern introduced
  by the preservation commits.
- The final range scan found live-looking values for `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and
  `INTAKE_WEAVIATE_API_KEY` in tracked `Intake/backend/.env.example`. Both values
  were already identical in `origin/main`; neither value was printed. The tracked
  example now contains Credential Manager placeholders. Both exposed credentials
  require owner-controlled rotation because removing them from the current file does
  not remove them from existing remote Git history. This reconciliation does not
  rewrite remote history or rotate credentials.
- `repair-tool-kit/COMPACT-SUMMARY-2026-09-12.md` and root `version` remain present
  locally and are ignored. The latter is a 12,288-byte DuckDB runtime database.

The preservation branch rebased cleanly onto `origin/main` at `1db6e9d`. Both
R2/B2 commits, `fc58c1c` and `1db6e9d`, are verified ancestors of the reconciled
branch. Post-rebase validation again passed all 107 Intake backend tests. The
publishable content tip `f06a14956096993836205e5de86b466e756e8213` was pushed to
`origin/codex/consignatio-preserve-20260913`; the receipt-only commit that contains
this final push record is pushed to the same branch immediately afterward.

Final range checks cover 64 changed files: no file exceeds 5 MiB, `git diff --check`
passes, and the high-confidence private-key/provider-token/credential-URL scan has
zero findings after sanitization. The canonical checkout has no tracked or untracked
publishable remainder. The two ignored local artifacts listed above remain present.
