# Catalog reconciliation: verified implementation receipt

Byline: Codex | 2026-09-20 | Generation: `2c2ae40f-bc6a-43c6-83a7-f3d60319e4d3`

> **Moved 2026-09-26 (Claude Code · Opus 5.5; owner 09:32 "yes, do that").** The Parquet generations and `generation-02/catalog.duckdb` now live on ovh-files at `/data/consignatio/receipts/catalog-reconciliation-2026-09-20/`, md5-verified with `rclone check` (58 of 58 files, 0 differences). "Local SQL" below now means that VPS path. The local copies are staged in `to_be_deleted/2026-09-26-vps-offload/` for the owner to delete.

The first additive reconciliation layer is live in PostgreSQL and queryable from local Parquet. This verifies metadata linkage and conservation, not universal source quality or deletion safety.

## Live result

- PostgreSQL: `ovh-files-ts`, database `casebible`, new dated `raw_duck.reconcile_*_20260920` facts and `catalog_reconcile` views.
- Local SQL: `generation-02/catalog.duckdb`, reading immutable metadata Parquet.
- New PostgreSQL metadata relations occupy 6,413,991,936 bytes including indexes. The host had approximately 20 GiB available after publication; future full generations need a storage budget.
- Existing catalog tables and all source content were retained. No source downloads, uploads, deletions, moves, lifecycle changes or content indexing occurred.
- 1,567,456 source occurrences and 1,279,556 R2 catalog occurrences preserved.
- 568,069 B2 version records; 146,246 item-level review tasks.
- 1,560 native Google source IDs mapped to 1,560 Office and 1,560 PDF representations, all found in visible B2 objects by hash and size.
- 24 native source IDs checked directly in the two known Google accounts: all accessible and not trashed. These are provisional source-native BAS #1 candidates; content completeness and original authorship are not proved.
- No BAS #2 decision or R2 retirement was cleared. Complementary representations remain preserved for review.

## Current B2 inventory

| Top-level prefix | Visible objects | Visible bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| `consignatio` | 554,496 | 2,204,633,176,441 |
| `db_backups` | 24 | 27,119,210 |
| `infra-backups` | 6 | 13,493,889 |
| `_intake-engine-test-20260917` | 15 | 564,894 |
| `(root)` | 1 | 55,639 |
| `intake-catalog-added` | 11 | 0 |

Total: **554,553 objects / 2,204,674,410,073 bytes**.
Noncurrent uploaded versions: **6,749 / 10,563,715,232 bytes**. Hide markers: **6,760**. Unfinished large files: **7 files / 20 parts / 387,129,237 bytes**. All uploaded versions plus unfinished parts: **2,215,625,254,542 bytes**.

Hash/size groups with repeated visible storage: **40,479 groups**, **41,508 extra paths**, **30,260,018,805 repeated bytes**. These are physical-storage findings, not disposal instructions. Occurrence metadata remains independently important.

**Hash coverage limit:** 37 visible objects, totaling 337,987,455,100 bytes, lack a usable SHA-1 in B2 metadata. The repeated-byte figure covers supported SHA-1/size identities; it is not a complete dedupe certificate for those large objects. Existing MD5/version-ID and SHA-256 receipts remain recovery leads.

## PostgreSQL DuckDB engine

The live `casebible` database already has **pg_duckdb 1.1.0**, with embedded **DuckDB v1.4.3**. A read-only execution test produced `Custom Scan (DuckDBScan)` and the expected 12 native candidates in each Google account. No installation, restart or global configuration change was required.

`casebible/catalog_reconcile/analytics.py` provides named analytics queries with transaction-local DuckDB execution. PostgreSQL remains the authoritative store. The local DuckDB file is an additional inspection artifact. Direct B2/Parquet access from the server has not yet been certified. Some PostgreSQL-specific JSON functions require the native PostgreSQL path; this is why execution is selected per analytics session rather than forced globally. See the [version-matched pg_duckdb functions documentation](https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb/blob/v1.1.0/docs/functions.md).

## Coverage

| Source occurrence availability | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `historical_exact` | 1,450 |
| `no_usable_identity` | 73,318 |
| `visible_exact_elsewhere` | 4 |
| `visible_exact_path` | 1,492,684 |

The 1,450 historical matches retain exact B2 version IDs. They must not be mistaken for missing source bytes. The no-usable-identity bucket includes native Google items and old exclusions; it is not a loss count. Native/export representation links live separately in `native_exports`.

| R2 catalog linkage | Rows |
|---|---:|
| `historical_catalog_link` | 937 |
| `unresolved` | 28,069 |
| `visible_catalog_link` | 1,250,550 |

R2 links use the recorded MD5/SHA1 bridge or exact recorded B2 version IDs with matching key/size. R2 was not re-inventoried live in this slice. Original occurrence metadata and package completeness still require review.

## Recovery worklist

| Task | Priority | Items |
|---|---|---:|
| `native_export_linkage_conflict` | high | 1,560 |
| `native_source_metadata_check` | high | 1,560 |
| `package_completeness` | high | 608 |
| `r2_identity_review` | review | 29,006 |
| `recovery_quality_and_provenance` | high | 3,041 |
| `recovery_quality_and_provenance` | review | 37,263 |
| `relink_historical_version` | high | 1,450 |
| `unresolved_occurrence` | review | 71,758 |

Full item-level evidence is in `generation-02/recovery_worklist.csv` and Parquet, and in the live `recovery_worklist` view. Multiple tasks can refer to one artifact; these counts are not unique files.

## Provenance and quality

| Bucket | Evidence and limitation |
|---|---|
| Source-native/original candidate | 24 live Google native observations support provisional native representation candidates; original authorship and content quality remain unverified. |
| Verified copy | Byte-link evidence is recorded separately from provenance. No blanket copy-quality approval was issued. |
| Derived/unverified | 3,120 mapped Office/PDF export representations have visible B2 identities; native source equivalence is not inferred. Timeline and search projections remain UNVERIFIED. |
| Orphaned derivative | No derivative is declared orphaned from an absent direct link alone; parent/source relationships require further checks. |
| Malformed/partial | Legacy recovery manifest has 861 fail and 2,180 unsupported entries, all queued for review. These are historical claims, not new content tests. |
| Metadata-stripped/suspect | Thin local metadata and anomalous dates are flags. Missing catalog metadata is not proof that embedded file metadata was stripped. |
| Unknown | Unresolved identities, untested structure, unsupported formats and incomplete provider metadata remain explicit. |

Preserved package metadata: 608 atomic roots / 128,834 membership records; 542 export units / 499,712 membership records; 711 vault units. The 40,304 recovery records and 33,685 integrity holds are also frozen in Parquet. The old limited recovery scan and largest-trunk proposals do not establish BAS.

## Historical artifacts: UNVERIFIED

- `timeline_mvp_20260918`: two payloads plus directory marker; 101,009,949 visible bytes. No content read or canonical acceptance.
- `chat_events_20260918` and related provenance tables: retained historical outputs; row counts are in the exact catalog inventory.
- Weaviate and Surreal outputs: historical projections, not completeness or source-quality authorities. This publication does not rebuild or certify them.
- Prior twin merge decisions, restricted recovery-quality conclusions and reported recovery-image deletions remain unverified as retention decisions.

## Verification and limits

- 10 safety tests passed, including replacement versions, missing hash/size, occurrence preservation, duplicate version rejection and disallowed B2 APIs.
- PostgreSQL schema compiled in a rollback-only transaction before publication.
- Capture fingerprints, unique identities, row conservation and visible-to-version coverage passed.
- Publication was atomic; every new table count was read back. Additional live view checks are recorded in `live-verification.json`.
- The detailed live availability aggregation matched the generation counts. The operational summary now reads those validated counts; its read-back took approximately one second including SSH. A dedicated availability lookup index supports targeted occurrence review.
- Exact pre-publication counts for 238 user tables/views and 2,305 catalog fields are preserved. Two DuckDB extension tables are excluded from exact-count scope.
- PostgreSQL captures and paginated B2 listings have observation windows; they are not a cross-provider atomic snapshot.
- Initial `generation-01` timed out during its first export and remains preserved but unpublishable.
- Google probes cover 24 named IDs, not all 1,560 natives. Permissions/revision histories were not enumerated. No new OD/local/R2 content acquisition occurred.

## Next recovery work

Use the recorded source IDs and version links to finish metadata capability checks, compare original timestamps/EXIF/sidecars/container context, resolve R2 identities using existing SHA-256 receipts, and assess package completeness. Only then make evidence-backed BAS #1/#2 decisions or propose acquisitions. All R2 retirement statuses remain `not_cleared`.

## Artifacts

- Specification: `SPEC.md`; current Docstore record IDs are retained in the registration receipt.
- Implementation and read-only query examples: `casebible/catalog_reconcile/`.
- Private reproducible observations, hashes, inventories and receipts: `generation-02/`.
