"""Atomic tool: "SMS Backup & Restore" XML  ->  NormalizedRecords.

One format, one module, swappable (owner architecture: parsers are separate
atomic units). Handles the Android "SMS Backup & Restore" schema:
  <smses>  with <sms> and <mms> children
  <calls>  with <call> children
Attributes are epoch-MILLISECOND `date`, `address`/`contact_name`, and a
`type` whose meaning differs for messages vs calls.

Streams with xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse so multi-GB backups don't blow up
RAM (elements are cleared after mapping). Falls back to a sanitize-whole-file
parse only if the stream hits malformed XML (stray ampersands are common in
these dumps).

Body-less records (attachment-only MMS, empty sends) are KEPT and flagged rather
than dropped — see _map_sms. Byline: Claude Code . Opus 5 (1M) . 2026-08-01.

Provenance: Python port of dev-resources/Archives/dial-stack/mcp-servers/
ts-mcp-server/src/tools/SmsXmlParser.ts (+ the call-blocking forensic logic
from dial-stack ConflictAnalysisApp). Part of evidence-spine P1 (forensic
message parsers); capability parse.sms-xml (Workflow A / SBV vertical).

    full corpus in RAM. That is fine for the registry contract, which hands back a

    This yields instead, so a caller can batch straight into the raw layer with flat

    NOTE: the malformed-XML fallback is deliberately NOT mirrored here. That path
    calls `path.read_text()` on the whole file, which is exactly what streaming
    exists to avoid. On a ParseError this raises so the caller can decide, rather
    than silently ballooning to multi-GB.

    `on_reject(tag, index, attrib)` is called for every element the mapper refuses.

    the caller only gets one chance to write it down. Defaulting this to None keeps
