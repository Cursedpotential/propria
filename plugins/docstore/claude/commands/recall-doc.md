Docstore recall (any document type) for: $ARGUMENTS

!`C:/Users/matts/.local/bin/python3.exe "E:/AI_Workspace/Projects/Propria/Probata/probata/scripts/docstore/recall.py" doc $ARGUMENTS 2>&1`

Show the table exactly as printed. Then at most three bullets: which result answers the question, with its path. If the top score is under 0.3, say the store has no strong match rather than stretching a weak one. Add `--why` to see the matching passage, `--status all` to include superseded documents.
